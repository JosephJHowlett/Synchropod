1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
Okay.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.720
Thomas:  almost. There

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.420
Thomas: are, you guys hearing this through the microphone? Now.  no.

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.470
yeah, check

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.880
Evan Martinez - Stax: check one check one.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.810
Thomas: something seems to be all. Are you hearing below the microphone now?

7
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.400
Evan Martinez - Stax: I don't know. I I can't. We can't see what you're talking through.

8
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.740
Thomas: But does it sound like it's coming through the microphone or my laptop.

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.790
Thomas: You hear this?

10
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.500
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, okay.

11
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.429
Thomas: So we have a protocol now for pre-recording. Why don't we pull that up?

12
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.139
Thomas: Take a little look.

13
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:15.749
Thomas:  where is it?

14
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.220
Thomas: Organization

15
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:37.250
Thomas: recording checklist? Okay, if it's zoom. we're gonna check our microphones. Yeah, what am I do? A little check myself? Joey chooses the file name, and then the boys name our local tracks.

16
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.350
Evan Martinez - Stax: Huh.

17
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.039
Thomas: Joe, we chooses the vile name, and then we name our local tracks. It's one of the steps, one of the early steps after

18
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.510
Thomas: volume.

19
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.120
Thomas: Joe. You there?

20
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.229
Joseph Howlett: Yeah, I just put it. I put it in the chat.

21
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.290
Thomas: Why can't I fucking copy this

22
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.310
Thomas: that is so weird I like cannot copy

23
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.159
Thomas: something that's in the chat

24
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.089
Thomas: that's so fucking, annoying.

25
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.490
Thomas: 3 t.

26
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.719
Thomas: To oh.

27
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.129
Thomas: is it not 202, 3.

28
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.680
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, it is. It's 2023 tone.

29
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.740
Thomas: Well, I know that. But I I was just pointing it out that that's I don't mind.

30
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.080
Thomas: All right.

31
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.990
Thomas: Okay, let's open up our zoom settings. I'll just put a link here.

32
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.189
Thomas: I've got the checklist open, Tom, already.

33
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.340
Thomas: and then

34
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.729
Thomas: you got to click it in in the top left of the zoom settings are closed and the top left. It says, Original Santa free musicians, Colin.

35
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.750
Thomas: Tap it, and then it'll turn to on

36
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.830
Thomas:  and then.

37
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.580
annoyingly, something is wrong with my audio cable. I got to change it up. That'll take literally 10Â s.

38
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.270
Thomas: Tiny obey. Guy.

39
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.160
Evan Martinez - Stax: me

40
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.069
Joseph Howlett: still very quiet.

41
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.239
Evan Martinez - Stax: How about now? My better.

42
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.750
Joseph Howlett: Yeah. You're wait to it again.

43
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.630
Thomas: Check 1, 2. This is the sign of my voice.

44
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.810
Joseph Howlett: You sound good.

45
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.540
Thomas: I think

46
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.790
Joseph Howlett: I have to like.

47
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.989
Thomas: put you guys on the

48
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.310
Joseph Howlett: I have to like. I don't know. I don't know what I have to do I have to? I have to

49
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.520
Thomas: somebody. You're really echoing.

50
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.520
Joseph Howlett: It's Tom's thing.

51
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.110
Thomas: What's up.

52
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.480
Thomas: hey? Can you hear me? Now?

53
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.660
Evan Martinez - Stax: Check one. I'm testing recording? Hi! This is the sound of my voice. We're gonna be doing a debrief. Okay.

54
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.540
Joseph Howlett: I'm like, really hungry

55
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.350
Joseph Howlett: God, this echo is bad check. Yeah.

56
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.249
Evan Martinez - Stax: I think in the past. Tom used echo cancellation, and it got better.

57
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.090
Joseph Howlett: Yeah, I just muted him. And now I love my life.

58
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.500
Joseph Howlett: Hang on

59
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.940
like

60
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.970
Joseph Howlett: I have to do more testing. So I'm going to meet myself.

61
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.740
Evan Martinez - Stax: Give me. I'll be right back, guys while you're all setting up.

62
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.000
Thomas: Joe, how are you?

63
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.360
Thomas: This is me test.

64
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.670
Thomas: Okay, I'm ready to go.

65
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.400
Joseph Howlett: I'm having sound problems like. So now

66
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.600
Joseph Howlett: I'm still getting echo through your

67
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:06.720
Joseph Howlett: Mike, Tom.

68
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.390
Thomas: you're getting an echo.

69
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.490
Joseph Howlett: Yeah.

70
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.230
fuck

71
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.380
Joseph Howlett: you gotta do your like? Echo cancellation thing.

72
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.399
Thomas: Yeah, that that is already done. Unfortunately.

73
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.480
Joseph Howlett: socks.

74
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.239
Thomas: I don't know what's going on. Let me try quitting Reaper

75
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.740
Joseph Howlett: also like, don't I sound bad

76
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.299
Thomas: a little.

77
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:33.949
Joseph Howlett: I sound like

78
00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.870
Thomas: you're a little too loud. I think you're

79
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.220
Joseph Howlett: maybe I'm too close.

80
00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.529
Joseph Howlett: I just sounded like it sounded like I

81
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.220
Joseph Howlett: like low

82
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:54.269
Joseph Howlett: sample rate audio to me a little bit. Yeah, is the microphone facing backwards.

83
00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:00.490
Joseph Howlett: Let me try turning it around. It's no, it's definitely I mean, it's definitely facing the same way. It always does. But

84
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.309
Thomas: yeah, okay, that's not the issue.

85
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.020
Joseph Howlett: Okay, this is one way.

86
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:11.399
Thomas: This is another way, because obviously the first one. This is the third way. Okay, now, first, okay.

87
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.009
Joseph Howlett: yeah. Like, I just need a better mic.

88
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:25.960
Thomas: You don't sound terrible. I've been for days listening to or for hour. Yeah, for a days listening to your your fucking shot, Mike. Oh, yeah, I mean, I think.

89
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.360
Thomas: yeah, I mean, even the mic I'm using, I think, is an ideal for

90
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.959
Thomas: spoken word, really.

91
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.210
Thomas: But you sound okay to me.

92
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.480
Joseph Howlett: Okay.

93
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:43.969
Thomas: they should like, look on. I bet you could get a mic for like 50 bucks on Facebook marketplace, but might not be a priority.

94
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.140
Joseph Howlett: If it's 50 bucks, then fuck you.

95
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:58.019
Thomas: I think you could like the one that I was using like the shotgun, like, I found someone who was willing to sell me one for 50 bucks. And it was like a USB version.

96
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.279
Thomas: wow, yeah. they're like, not that expensive.

97
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.860
Joseph Howlett: Okay, this is my audio.

98
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.490
Joseph Howlett: This is now my audio.

99
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:16.750
Thomas: You sound a little out to me. But the only thing that matters is what's recording on your end. So I'm not worried about it.

100
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.779
Thomas: And it's still that going.

101
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.440
Joseph Howlett: Tess. No.

102
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:28.810
Thomas: it's better. Okay.

103
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.519
Joseph Howlett: okay, one more thing.

104
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.770
Joseph Howlett: Yes. So this is maybe where we like it.

105
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.960
Joseph Howlett: That sounds good. Yeah. Okay.

106
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.430
great.

107
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.570
Joseph Howlett: Let's keep going on the checklist, I guess.

108
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.599
Thomas: okay, let me pull it up again.

109
00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.160
Thomas: Where did they should go?

110
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:12.149
Thomas: Okay, my check volume done, Angle myipes and you got your pop fields are on. I think we're good there. we chose our file name. Original sound for musicians is on

111
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.149
Thomas: zoom recording is on. Now. We just got to turn on our local recordings and cloud.

112
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.920
Joseph Howlett: Okay,

113
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.290
Joseph Howlett: I'm recording.

114
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.970
Thomas: Why don't we wait for Evan?

115
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.120
Thomas: Okay? Or I'm I'm gonna wait for Evan. I know he's here. Never mind. Okay.

116
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.489
Thomas: time recording. I'm recording.

117
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.500
Joseph Howlett: All right. Joey's going to clap

118
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.879
Thomas: Tom clapping. It never works.

119
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.310
Joseph Howlett: It worked. I think it worked last time, too.

120
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.900
Thomas: so weird. so weird.

121
00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:56.810
Joseph Howlett: Who

122
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.030
Joseph Howlett: my pitch is good.

123
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.810
Thomas: Yeah. yeah, that was like 4, 40,

124
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.230
Thomas: maybe 4, 41. But you know, it's worth 21

125
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.040
Thomas: for anyone.

126
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.290
Thomas: Great example of my executive functioning problems is that

127
00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:35.989
Thomas: my USB mice, a mouse has been dead for 5 days and it every time I use my computer it's like fuck. I could probably do it right now. You know, I could just plug it in.

128
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.100
Thomas: It's a plug in. Yeah, I got a new video game system. Look at this.

129
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:48.550
Thomas: Well, that looks crazy. It's got a crank in it that some of the games use this crank

130
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.410
Joseph Howlett: for what

131
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.110
Thomas: it's just like.

132
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:59.019
Joseph Howlett: It's another thing they can do. It depends on the game. Yeah, it's another way to control shit. So I don't like, some of them are probably fishing games.

133
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.199
Thomas: So that's the only thing that controls the movement. What's it called

134
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.340
Thomas: play 8.

135
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:14.649
Thomas: Unfortunately. Yeah. I tried to tell you guys this a year ago. That's funny.

136
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.029
Joseph Howlett: At least it's not a app.

137
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.839
Thomas: No, but I don't want anything to be an app. Frankly.

138
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.980
Thomas: I think Evan doesn't know he's muted.

139
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.349
Evan Martinez - Stax: I did not know I was muted correct.

140
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:52.290
Thomas: It looked like you were like part of the conversation.

141
00:13:52.400 --> 00:14:21.460
Joseph Howlett: I was really into it, and there were like pauses for Evan. Well, actually, I had a couple of good quips that got no response. I was like old crowd. Actually, I just realized, I said, it doesn't matter that your audio is too loud. But we want the zoom recorded to be okay. So you're all just. I just have to turn up the gain. And I think on my personal. And, Evan, you're really quiet, and then I'm going to go like here, maybe. How about that?

142
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:28.279
Thomas: That's I sound good in my headset. Is there any way to boost it up because we want the

143
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.949
Evan Martinez - Stax: bye, bye. if I go higher, I'm going to start redlining on reaper.

144
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.030
Okay?

145
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.450
Thomas:  all right. Well, I guess we'll

146
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.370
Thomas: do what we can.

147
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.339
Thomas:  Evan, can you clap?

148
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:51.240
Thomas: I did. I already did once. One thing that sucks in it, so it doesn't count. One thing that sucks is. I'm kind of

149
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:59.659
Joseph Howlett: always getting room tone, like New York sounds from one of you. Zoom usually like cuts it in and out. You know.

150
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:05.489
Thomas: I'm going to mute myself. It's probably me. Maybe you're maybe you're loud, Tom.

151
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.060
I can turn down. My room is just really loud, unfortunately.

152
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.660
Thomas: So I turned. Yeah. Oh, wait! That's the wrong thing. Now I turn down. How's that?

153
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.260
Thomas: How's that sound

154
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:19.840
Thomas: any better?

155
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:26.889
Thomas: No, but maybe let's just go. I think it's fine. Okay, I'm gonna

156
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:35.620
Thomas: Do I sound quieter or louder or louder? That's good. I'm louder now. I like that even a little louder would be great if you can

157
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.090
Evan Martinez - Stax: again. I, I turn that into power. Yeah, yeah.

158
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.950
Joseph Howlett: okay, you.

159
00:15:44.390 --> 00:16:03.249
Joseph Howlett: All right, we're ready to go. Kind of yeah. Yeah. Had a huge lunch just now that I feel too full. It's I'm I'm so hungry. And I'm worried that I'm gonna get mad at you guys because of it. So I wish I could like vomit food into my mouth, or something like a baby bird. Yeah, could you, baby bird? Me? I would do that for you, Joe. Thanks.

160
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:08.040
Joseph Howlett: That's actually we'll get into it. But that's weirdly what I've been doing all week.

161
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.769
Thomas: The dollar, apparently like the Lama community.

162
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:20.220
Thomas: like the Dalai Lama got in trouble because they said he was a pedophile, because he told a kid to suck his tongue. But apparently that's like a saying, because in that

163
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.189
Thomas: I don't know what you call it.

164
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:32.679
Thomas: That tradition, like the elders will chew up food for the kids, and then when there's nothing left, they go eat my tongue because it's like, Oh, I'm even going to give you my tongue. Wow!

165
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:42.239
Thomas: So he's not a pedophile. He's actually just a giver. That's good. Oh, wait! I have some nuts I'm going to eat like 5 knots hang on. Oh, yeah, can you eat some dust?

166
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:48.150
Thomas: I've been eating nuts all day. so, Evan,

167
00:16:49.220 --> 00:17:04.339
I added some more grants. I started going through the grants that we had, and. like some of my next, like, there was one that was like only for people in Indiana, but like, I think we just didn't notice. And then I'm like putting them in different categories, like a lot of money or a little money. I guess we

168
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.870
okay, yeah, cool.

169
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.500
Thomas: I mean, not

170
00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:10.380
right.

171
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.949
Thomas: It'll pay off in the long run.

172
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.940
Thomas: Could you train your closer and I go on that

173
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.069
Thomas: like I don't. I can't even tell you reading nuts

174
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.519
Thomas: all right. Who wants to kick this off

175
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:40.459
Thomas: me? But I have to eat. Well, hurry up. Yeah, easy nuts. Evan. Come on, give a man a chance to eat nuts. Eat your goddamn nuts, Evan. You do anything tonight?

176
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:47.139
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, I'm going to. So, Julia, you know. Do you remember, Julia? She's the Ny professor with Jane?

177
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:57.779
Evan Martinez - Stax: Oh, yeah. Our friends of Jane, I mean, she's moving to to Los Angeles because she she got a job at Ucla. So I you, yeah. Yeah. And so.

178
00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:06.610
Evan Martinez - Stax: yeah, well, we're just playing me, Jane, Jose and her. We're all going to her apartment to play moves tonight and have dinner. What about you?

179
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.000
Thomas: I don't know. I was gonna say, see a movie. But I'm also like

180
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.289
Thomas: as excited about being home alone, stone playing video games. So

181
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:23.210
Thomas: that does sound fun. Yeah, you have video games. You can be crank. You're gonna be cranking that crank

182
00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:34.029
Joseph Howlett: like. Where's Tom? It's always crank in it again I peaked there. That was good. That was a good test of my peaking.

183
00:18:34.030 --> 00:19:00.669
Thomas: Oh, just lowered my gain a little bit. Oh, my God, I don't want to peek you guys, Peak, I'm good. I love Evan that you added one that's like a LGBT. Grant. It's like we're gonna try and sneak in with you. No, no, it said. If one of your, if one of the creators is is, and I'm like, that's a great I'm going to look up more. Actually, because I think we actually do qualify for me.

184
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:09.969
Thomas: Yeah. And it's the only thing we're ever gonna qualify for? I don't have to change anything for that

185
00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:16.069
Thomas: like, no, I identify some man. Okay, I can kick this off all right. Go for it.

186
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.440
Joseph Howlett: so.

187
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.670
Joseph Howlett: Evan. it's now

188
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:31.249
Joseph Howlett: June 20, fourth. We left Sedona on June sixth, and you left, I think, on the ninth. Is that right you left on Friday.

189
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:35.499
Evan Martinez - Stax: Correct. So it's been for you

190
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:41.240
Joseph Howlett: like pretty much exactly 2 weeks since he left Sedona. So I'm wondering.

191
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.010
Thomas: First of all, I have. I guess I have 2 questions. My first question is.

192
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.230
Joseph Howlett: how are you feeling?

193
00:19:48.280 --> 00:20:01.969
Joseph Howlett: Has has anything come up or changed with respect to your feelings about our experience in Sedona. Have you been having any more spiritual kind of experience than you did before? And then my second question is.

194
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:12.930
Joseph Howlett: what in general has been going on in your life in the last 2 weeks. like. like, what has anything happened with any of the personal life stuff we've been talking about?

195
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.080
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah,

196
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:24.810
Evan Martinez - Stax: So I had a great time in stone. I still, you know, I like I really look back at that time with you guys and just be in like

197
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.460
Evan Martinez - Stax: it makes me smile

198
00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:40.460
Evan Martinez - Stax:  because I like. I'm as I said before, and I I was just so happy to share my hometown with you guys, and I think you guys both really liked it, which makes me

199
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.410
Thomas: it lay elated, you know, you know, loved it.

200
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.239
Thomas: Oh, God! I now I have a

201
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:53.250
Thomas: Whoa! I'm not hearing your echo. It just started.

202
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.429
Thomas: Why am I not here? That's weird. I think it gets

203
00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.879
Joseph Howlett: test test test. Yes, through, Tom. Sorry time I muted you because it went away.

204
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.620
Joseph Howlett: But it's weird, because it like, just start it just like clicked on.

205
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.210
Evan Martinez - Stax: That's so weird.

206
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.409
Joseph Howlett: And also at the same time

207
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:17.079
Joseph Howlett: the fucking room tone went away. It's like every we're not getting a

208
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:22.090
Evan Martinez - Stax: we're not getting a bunch of yeah.

209
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:31.449
Thomas:  So Tom's muted. So we have to figure this out. Hold on! Is it crazy? Echo? Now, yeah, yeah.

210
00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.159
Thomas: it's like, it's not an

211
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:46.880
Joseph Howlett: I'm ming you. It's not an echo through your speakers into it. It's not like feedback. It's like literally playing the really good audio into our ears

212
00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:57.959
Thomas: a second after, I will just keep him muted. And then, when you want to ask a question, you can unmute that that's not going to work like cause. Then when I talk, it's going to be all fucked up. I'm going to try leaving the call and coming back

213
00:21:58.670 --> 00:21:59.700
Thomas: more.

214
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:10.140
Evan Martinez - Stax: Why does it only have with Tom's audio? I don't know his. His like zoom is the worst zoom of all time.

215
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:36.790
Joseph Howlett: He's gonna hear this and be bad. But I I just I just like I just like at any opportunity I can to point out that he should have got a macbook pro, even if it's totally unrelated. Like, yeah. Echo, man, you should have got the pro. Yeah. Well that that that applies to me, too. So yeah, well, you got a better for, or you got a better error than him, because you don't have the same problem. Yeah.

216
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:48.109
Evan Martinez - Stax: what were your 2 questions again, Joe, just while we are waiting? Well, I I want to invert them. Actually, how about now? What's happening now.

217
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:56.330
Thomas: One. No echo. Good! No echo. What about now?

218
00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:07.049
Thomas: No. Oh, that goes back.

219
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.849
Evan Martinez - Stax: Check. We all. We're good.

220
00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.990
Thomas: We're good. Yeah.

221
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.910
Thomas: I turn on echo cancellation

222
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.070
Thomas: in the past that didn't work.

223
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:23.200
Evan Martinez - Stax: It'll come back. Yeah. Why? Why don't we start over? Oh, wait. It's check one. Okay, it's gone

224
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:30.789
Joseph Howlett: all right, Joe. Ask your shit again. All right, Evan. I have 2 questions to kick this off first is like.

225
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:43.690
Joseph Howlett: I think, first, I want to ask, like, what in general has happened in your life in the last 2 weeks since you've been back like, what is, what have things been like? Has anything changed? Yeah, just like. Tell me what's up

226
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:50.610
Evan Martinez - Stax: the last 2 weeks has been have been

227
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.020
Evan Martinez - Stax: pretty great like

228
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:57.390
Evan Martinez - Stax: a little up and down with the the house. I'm trying to get in, Bushwick.

229
00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:06.419
Evan Martinez - Stax: The bank keeps saying dumb shit that pisses me off, but spiritually like I have my crystals around my apartment.

230
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:16.269
Evan Martinez - Stax: I really enjoy just kind of picking them up and like having them in the space, which is obviously something new. I've never had them before.

231
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.350
Evan Martinez - Stax: I started dating. Well, I'm supposed to go on a date with a guy tomorrow.

232
00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:30.599
Evan Martinez - Stax: and I know I told you I told you guys before, like I was going to wait until, like the house, or the job, or both, were taken care of

233
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:36.489
Evan Martinez - Stax: before I jumped into the dating pool. But, like fuck it, you know, like, who cares? Why not?

234
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.920
Evan Martinez - Stax:  And

235
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:54.589
Evan Martinez - Stax: yeah, I mean, I I don't know really what else to say. But in the last 2 weeks from Sedona, like the trip was, the trip was had such an impact on me like I'm still kind of beaming from it, you know, like I like, I am having residual

236
00:24:54.620 --> 00:25:03.700
Evan Martinez - Stax: like residual good times from it even today. Wow! I mean, how much of that stuff that's going on? The positive stuff.

237
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:07.409
Thomas: do you think is because of Sedona, or at least related.

238
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:18.619
Evan Martinez - Stax: I mean, I always love going back to home and like being, you know, like having a moment to so sort of unplug from the chaos of New York City

239
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.020
Evan Martinez - Stax: and

240
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:29.200
Evan Martinez - Stax: grounding myself in the town and the rocks and the hikes, and the friends right? So, like all of that stuff usually feels

241
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:48.739
Evan Martinez - Stax: sorry. All of that stuff is usually carried with me when I come back. So I think it's a very high chance. Definitely. Was it different this time than other times. Yeah, for sure. I mean, you know, obviously, all of the work that we did, and like the spiritual endeavors that we all participated in participated in together

242
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.779
Evan Martinez - Stax: was a lot different. Taking you guys

243
00:25:52.870 --> 00:26:02.749
Evan Martinez - Stax: to Sedona. Just period was also something new, and that was really exciting for me, because I very rarely get to take some. I very rarely get to take friends to Sedona.

244
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:10.279
Evan Martinez - Stax: so there was a lot new about this, for sure. So you've been working the crystals in. You've been touching them, and stuff! Where are they in your apartment?

245
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:18.830
Evan Martinez - Stax: So the 2 big ones are on the my coffee table. They're in the top right corner. If you're sitting on the couch looking at the television.

246
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:22.860
Evan Martinez - Stax: is that like, what is that like within reach? If you're sitting on the couch.

247
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:38.059
Joseph Howlett: It's not. No, it's not. No, okay, yeah. I think you should move them within reach. Yeah, no, you you should put them, I think maybe on the like autumn, and it's not an ottoman.

248
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:49.740
Joseph Howlett: You know. What I mean. The is that the coffee table, the thing that's like right in front of you. You you're sitting. Yeah. Oh, okay, yeah. So put it on the corner. That's closest to where you are, so you can reach it when you're watching TV or whatever. Okay, yeah, it sounds good.

249
00:26:49.840 --> 00:27:01.910
Evan Martinez - Stax: yeah. I think the other thing that is different is how I look at Sedona, too, after this trip, you know, like, after exploring this spiritual side of the town, it's it's a

250
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:08.180
Evan Martinez - Stax: like it feels like I accept Sedona for all that it has to offer now.

251
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:37.769
Evan Martinez - Stax: whereas before I was kind of picking and choosing the components of the town that I loved. But now it's like, you know, it's like a relationship. It's like I love you for exactly who you are, with all of your crazy and exciting red rocks that are beautiful and shutting in. And you know as well as like your spiritual components and all of the people that you come, all of the people you have coming through your town like, I really I feel like I I love the town now

252
00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:41.139
Evan Martinez - Stax: in its entirety rather than

253
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.380
Evan Martinez - Stax: a

254
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:49.060
Evan Martinez - Stax: rather than it being conditional love, you know. And that's really it feels really good

255
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.499
Thomas: joy. Can I go or do you want to?

256
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.979
Joseph Howlett: You can go?

257
00:27:53.750 --> 00:28:04.129
Thomas:  I mean, that's interesting. You talk about like loving every part of the town and accepting it. For who it is that's Often! How people talk about learning to love themselves!

258
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.330
Thomas: Is there any? Has anything shifted in your relationship with yourself, due to the like

259
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:15.549
Thomas: changing feelings about your hometown and about your own potential spirituality.

260
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.130
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, I mean, I

261
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.650
let me see.

262
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:40.149
Evan Martinez - Stax: I mean I I S. Sedona is so much a part of me, so I'm sure that there is some crossover like the spiritual side of me. That is new is is everything that we talked about and everything that you know we talked about working on, which is

263
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:51.840
Evan Martinez - Stax: having the crystals being more intentional. When I think about Sedona and my place within the universe connected to it.

264
00:28:52.130 --> 00:29:02.999
Evan Martinez - Stax: you know. Just like you, Kuala said. Right? Like paying attention to the nuances of spirituality is definitely something new and exciting for me, because it feels

265
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.800
Evan Martinez - Stax: it feels more appropriate for me like it feels like it's

266
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.420
Evan Martinez - Stax: a

267
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.130
Evan Martinez - Stax: it's. It's like better suited for me, and

268
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:19.950
Evan Martinez - Stax: in terms of like loving myself more or more completely, you know, like I feel towards Sedona.

269
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:32.279
Evan Martinez - Stax: I mean I I don't know I I don't think there's been a huge shift, I mean, I think there's a small shift in that for sure, like any time you feel like I. I just think, yeah, any time like.

270
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:44.359
Evan Martinez - Stax: So any opportunity I can to feel closer to Sedona and like, if I love Sedona more, then sure there are parts of me spiritually wise that I'm I'm sure I've adopted and and and

271
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:49.630
Evan Martinez - Stax: like, approve of and and accept right more fully than I did, and that feels good.

272
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:56.460
Thomas: Well, I mean, that's a bigger change than I think you could expect. You know, it's pretty huge.

273
00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:04.729
Evan Martinez - Stax: I mean it. It feels very small to me to be honest like it feels like it like I don't feel like a like a

274
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:15.689
Thomas: I mean it. It feels well, any small change in your relationship to yourself is, it is a big deal, even if it's a tiny thing, right?

275
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:17.810
Thomas: Because you have that at least. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

276
00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:26.099
Evan Martinez - Stax: yeah, sure. I mean, let me ask you guys now, it's been what 2 weeks, 3 weeks since you left. What are you guys doing? I'm not done with you.

277
00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.949
Joseph Howlett: so you mentioned

278
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:44.740
Joseph Howlett: you mentioned the house stuff. Can you go into more detail about that like? when we were in Sedona? You see, you seemed like very pessimistic, like, very unlikely that it was gonna work out. Do you still feel that way based on what's happened the last few weeks?

279
00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:50.379
Evan Martinez - Stax:  I think it is going to work out.

280
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:54.079
Evan Martinez - Stax: I think I think it's going to come through.

281
00:30:54.270 --> 00:31:02.789
Evan Martinez - Stax: Wow! But I hate feeling that way because I have felt that way so many times before. With this house and with the house I bought with a

282
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.240
Evan Martinez - Stax: like, even though the one with tamour came through eventually. There were so many times. Huh?

283
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.820
Thomas: Ex-boyfriend.

284
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:15.440
Thomas: yeah, yeah. I mean, there was so many Tamar is. So if we're going to use someone's name, we should say it.

285
00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:45.200
Evan Martinez - Stax: There were so many times like with that house where we were like, okay, this is it. We got the closing date set. We're going. And then some big problem happens and you know it. Then we have the feeling like it's all falling apart. And it's anything with this right? Like, I feel good. I think it's going to happen, but I also. I've been bitten by the snake of Bank of America before, and so, you know, I know better. I know better than to like, believe 100%. So you're being, you're being careful. But but

286
00:31:45.220 --> 00:32:07.190
Joseph Howlett: like, okay, let's let's recognize that for what it is. The last 2 weeks have come. Wh. What has happened in the last 2 weeks in your life since you went back to New York have been has been a complete 180. With respect to the house, you you are getting only bad news and feeling only pessimistic. And yes, it's complicated. And yes, you don't want to get your hopes up. But the last 2 weeks have

287
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:28.600
Evan Martinez - Stax: boated really. Well, well, there are concrete reasons for all of this, though it's not like it like these. The the reason for my 180 is not just simply my feelings, like there's no I know I'm saying like actual things have happened. You've gotten really good news in the last 2 weeks. Right? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so I just, I just want to clock. But it's bitter. It's also bittersweet, like, I don't feel

288
00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:37.099
Evan Martinez - Stax: like, even if I get this. And I, I don't know if we're going to use this part in the podcast but, like you, you know, even if the House comes through like, it's a very bittersweet.

289
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:47.719
Evan Martinez - Stax: like accomplishment for me, because, you know, the bank found out I lost my job, and so they were going to pull the plug. I asked if I could add my dad to it.

290
00:32:47.760 --> 00:33:10.579
Evan Martinez - Stax: He said yes, initially, but then realized like he just didn't want to fuck around with the bank. It was a hassle blah blah blah, and I was like cool, no problem all good. And then I found out that I was going to lose my deposits. So I I went back to my dad and I was like, Hey, man, this is the situation. I know you said no, I just wanted to ask you one more time, otherwise there goes $24,000 if you still say no like. I've

291
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.220
Evan Martinez - Stax: fully accept that. All good right. And he said, Yes.

292
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:34.370
Evan Martinez - Stax: but so now if I get the house, it's like. Well, I got the house because I asked my dad to like be on the loan with me, so you know, against his will, like he already expressed. He didn't want to, so like. It's very bittersweet. And even though it's not even though he's not giving me any money for the down payment or mortgage like. It's just an like an insurance policy.

293
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:59.619
Joseph Howlett: It it's still like, I feel like I have forced my parents into something that they have voiced. You know their opinions in the opposite, like they they don't want to do it. That was done. Yeah, but they just don't want to do it. So it'll yeah, yeah, it wasn't just a gift they were gonna give you. You had to. You were talking about the difficulty you had with this. You had to go to them and like ask them to go out on a limb for you in this way, and that's been really difficult for you.

294
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:10.469
Evan Martinez - Stax: I had to. I had to ask them. Yeah, I had to. I had to ask them to help me protect my deposit of $24,000. Yeah, and that's not easy for you.

295
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.390
Evan Martinez - Stax: It wasn't easy for me to like

296
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:20.100
Evan Martinez - Stax: I was. I was okay asking them the first time before I realized about the deposit. Right?

297
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:36.009
Evan Martinez - Stax: you know that it was fine, right they they weren't giving me any money for it like this. This was all coming from me. It was just because it was for the and it was for insurance for the bank. The second time I asked them, though, after they already said no, that that felt dirty, you know, like you, you want to

298
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.210
Evan Martinez - Stax: like. I I want to get to a place where my parents

299
00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:50.850
Evan Martinez - Stax: can rely on me for whatever they need, as they get older, and granted, they will likely never be a day when they need me for money.

300
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:58.879
Evan Martinez - Stax: But like it's like a full package image that I'm trying to present right? Which is, I have my shit together enough. Where, like

301
00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:11.570
Evan Martinez - Stax: you guys are in your seventys now, eightys around the corner, like, I want you to know that I am somebody to rely on in times of need. Now for you. As your life starts to change, so

302
00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:22.060
Evan Martinez - Stax: it hurt. Yeah, it sucked definitely. It definitely sorry it definitely sucked to go back and ask them for help again after they already said, No, for sure. And so

303
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:28.579
Joseph Howlett: well, no, you can finish. No, that was it. What about What about the job? Hunt?

304
00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:41.909
Evan Martinez - Stax: J. Job hunt is going well, I mean, I'm putting in a a fuck load of applications every every day and every week. You know I signed up with this company called Pathrise.

305
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.280
Evan Martinez - Stax: Hmm.

306
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:51.990
Evan Martinez - Stax: and I pay them money, and they in in exchange they give me.

307
00:35:51.990 --> 00:36:14.800
Evan Martinez - Stax: They're I'm a part of like this big network that they have. They have like industry mentors. They help me with resumes and Linkedin, and and then they have, like quotas each week in terms of like. I have to submit X number of applications every single week. I have to do X number of cold emails every single week as follow up. So it it is. It's the structure I need

308
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:23.159
Evan Martinez - Stax: right now, as I apply for jobs, because I was getting really, really burned down.

309
00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.250
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, yeah.

310
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:35.989
Joseph Howlett: And yeah. And you were feeling really burnt out when we were in Sedona, like you were saying, I I don't know. I really am not looking forward to going fully deep back into the job on putting those applications in and stuff.

311
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:42.849
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, yeah, no, I wasn't, and I still don't. But like now that I have pathrise as sort of

312
00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:49.240
Evan Martinez - Stax:  help. Now that I have like the help from this other company.

313
00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.069
Evan Martinez - Stax: So it, yeah. But

314
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.720
Joseph Howlett: no. Now that you have the help from the other company.

315
00:36:54.740 --> 00:37:13.919
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, like. Now, now that I have help right now that pathways is helping me, and I don't feel like I'm alone. it! It always feels a lot better. So it sounds like in the job department. You've spent the last 2 weeks really planting a lot of seeds right? Like putting putting a lot of things out there and really making some progress and feeling productive about it.

316
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:27.070
Joseph Howlett: Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely. And has there been any change in direction in that job hunt like, are you looking at any types of different jobs than you would have before? Or are you going in any new direction in terms of kind of companies you're applying for

317
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:37.500
Joseph Howlett:  like, do you find yourself applying to new types of companies that you weren't really considering before?

318
00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.900
I

319
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:49.109
Evan Martinez - Stax: I want, I want to say no, but I am

320
00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.399
Evan Martinez - Stax: putting time into companies and industries.

321
00:37:54.390 --> 00:38:06.719
Evan Martinez - Stax: I'm putting more time into companies, industry, and industries that I previously was. that I previously like wasn't doing very much any new industry in particular.

322
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.910
Evan Martinez - Stax: Not and again, not new industries. But I'm just putting more time. I'm trying to

323
00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:22.239
Evan Martinez - Stax: even out the eggs I have in my baskets rather than going full force into only green tech or sustainability

324
00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:35.470
Evan Martinez - Stax: or even just startups. I'm I'm rather I'm instead, I'm like trying to just even out, you know where I put applications in. So that I improve my chances. Because, yeah, yeah, what industries in particular?

325
00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:46.209
Evan Martinez - Stax: I'm doing a lot of green tech. Still, environmental companies I'm doing media companies. Is that new?

326
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:57.419
Evan Martinez - Stax: No, I've done media in the past. But you're doing more of it now. I'm doing some more of it now, like as it comes available. I actually talked to Lex and Darius yesterday last night about.

327
00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:03.850
Evan Martinez - Stax: you know, if there's a job opening at paramount that I think I'm right, for would they give me a referral? And they are both. We're like, yeah, absolutely

328
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:08.110
Evan Martinez - Stax: interesting. Would you have considered paramount like 6 months ago.

329
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:30.700
Evan Martinez - Stax: I mean, I know you'd consider anything. But do you think that would have popped on your radar 6 months ago, could you, or was that not the type of thing I mean? It wasn't on my radar. No, no, it it it wasn't on my radar just because I wasn't. I wasn't like I I don't know only recently that I realized that, like paramount the universals, the you know, all these have like

330
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:55.110
Evan Martinez - Stax: the jobs that I'm looking for like they have program, manager positions, project manager positions. So yeah, okay, before, before, before, it was not really on my radar as much. Okay. So this might have felt like kind of a fact. Gathering expedition so far. Kind of a slog, maybe. But it's I think it's about to bear fruit. So this morning I listen back this morning I listen back to the astrologer session.

331
00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.890
Joseph Howlett:  And that's because I remembered that really, in particular, the last 2 weeks

332
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:12.570
Joseph Howlett: were the beginning of a new phase for you, and that came up like specific dates in June, came up again and again in that meeting in that session.

333
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:36.530
Joseph Howlett: But you know, in terms of specifics, I wanted to go back and like really understand, because there was just so much info in that session. And I also want to say, like, that's the thing that really resonated. Maybe most with you of all the things we tried. Right? Yeah, yeah, I love the astrology session. Yeah. So just to maybe to refresh your memory, because we've all kind of you know, it's been a bit. And it was so much information. please do.

334
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.329
Joseph Howlett: Yeah. So he said.

335
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.670
Joseph Howlett: he said, in particular, that

336
00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:48.780
Joseph Howlett: you know the the previous period has been difficult for you, and the the pager, turning, has a lot to do with

337
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.749
Joseph Howlett: leaving old things behind.

338
00:40:51.770 --> 00:41:11.150
Joseph Howlett: Starting a new completion, introspection, and letting go of the past, he said, you climb a mountain and reach this plateau. And now you're kind of like looking back at what you've accomplished in the last 12 years or so, and then you're moving through a gate into this like new chapter of your life, and dropping baggage behind.

339
00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.769
Joseph Howlett: So think about like turning a new leave.

340
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:34.319
Joseph Howlett: He also said, that it's a will be a period of spiritual growth, even if you don't try the next year, he said, that even if you don't try like this, the the ground is right for spiritual growth. In the next year, even if you don't try, you will grow spiritually, but if you do make a little bit of effort. You'll really, really grow spiritually. So I think that little bit of effort you're putting in is huge.

341
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:43.040
Joseph Howlett: Yeah, he talked about some things that are difficult for you like asking for help is one of them which I think is interesting. We were just talking about how

342
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:53.599
Joseph Howlett: this period has been kind of bittersweet for you because of that particular difficulty of going to your parents at that moment and asking them to go out on that limb for you and do something that was maybe difficult

343
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:59.919
Joseph Howlett: for them, or that they weren't totally comfortable with. So I just wanted to highlight that

344
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:12.419
Joseph Howlett: But another thing is that, you know, he said, that this was going to be a good dating year for you, but to go slow. He's he seemed to feel that 2025 was gonna be the real

345
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:25.989
Joseph Howlett: turning point in turn, honestly on the marriage chart. That might be when you meet the person you eventually merit, Mary, although he said, go slow with marriage as well. you'll remember, and I also want to highlight that.

346
00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:33.879
Joseph Howlett: I also want to highlight that, he said in terms of jobs.

347
00:42:34.290 --> 00:43:01.820
Joseph Howlett: This is a really important period for you. And then, in particular, these 3 weeks of June are when you're going to be planting a lot of siege that come to fruition over the following 6 months, the period beginning in June and ending in January of February of next year. He thinks that this is the time that you're really going to plant seeds that come, that that bare fruit. And he said that it might involve looking into new kinds of areas. Job-wise

348
00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:26.329
Joseph Howlett: in particular, he said. And you know this didn't resonate with you at the time, and it really felt like it was one of those moments, you know those moments in all of these things where you're like? Maybe astrology's fake because it just feels so false. He was like, have you ever thought about communications like, kind of the media television radio like is that something you might consider? And we were all kind of like, I don't. I don't see it

349
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.300
Joseph Howlett: so I mean I just

350
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:47.290
Joseph Howlett: you know I I I cheated I mean, I did talk to Alexis this morning, and I heard that you mentioned the paramount, but like I also, I also didn't need to say it like I got you to say it, and I don't know that's crazy I've never heard. And then you you followed it up. You didn't just say paramount. Right? What list the companies? You just set a gun?

351
00:43:48.000 --> 00:44:11.050
Evan Martinez - Stax: well, I I you said paramount. You said A. But I do a couple of positions at Nbc. Universal. Yeah. But I got nose from both of them. Unfortunately, okay, I gotta say, these, yeah, this is all. Yeah, we have the list on the record. But anyway, you listed like 4 or 5 companies that are media companies and yeah, communications companies. And I gotta say the entire time I've known you.

352
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:18.209
Joseph Howlett: you've been looking for jobs and I've never heard any Bdr communications companies come up. So I just think that's really interesting.

353
00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:41.539
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, I mean, I hate. I don't want to burst your bubble, but I have applied in the past way before the trip to Sedona. Yeah, you you said so. And you said that these these new areas aren't really new, but they are areas of of new energy for you. You are kind of putting energy. I mean, the words you said is that that wouldn't have been on your radar 6 months ago. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I mean, I really, I really loved the astrology session like I said, you know, it really felt like it.

354
00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.639
Evan Martinez - Stax: It

355
00:44:43.890 --> 00:45:13.379
Evan Martinez - Stax: lifted some of the burden of all this shit that I have to figure out over the next, like, you know, 2 to 3 months. So I'm yeah to hear that that things are kind of falling in line as as the guy projected. They really are. And I I just want to say one more thing. This had to do with the geographic part. Remember, when he drew the lines on the map? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So he said in Nyc in particular, which I think this is interesting, because it's all like in these 2 weeks after you got home. he said. This is a period of career restructuring.

356
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:26.399
Joseph Howlett: It's a period of it's not about. It's not good. You you asked. Would it be fruitful? Would it be good, like good luck or bad, or what? He said. It's not good or bad. It's about looking at things, you already know, in the clear light of day.

357
00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:39.249
Joseph Howlett: And I would say, that's really true. Everything you're saying about the last 2 weeks is things you knew in Sedona that you you need to put this new energy in. You need to look broader. You need help, and you're recognizing that.

358
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:47.410
Joseph Howlett: But you know it's all looking really stark like you're really looking at things in the clear light of day here. And I I think that's really

359
00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:52.079
Joseph Howlett: that you're on track for this next 6 months. And he also said that

360
00:45:52.410 --> 00:46:10.469
Joseph Howlett: the next 6 months will be fruitful for you career-wise, but 2025 to 2027 is gonna be a a period of really strong career and monetary success. So I think we should look. I'll I'll come back to you in 2,025 to 2,027, to make sure that you're going to be like

361
00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.560
Joseph Howlett: I don't know, like Richard Branson, or something by then.

362
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:16.260
Evan Martinez - Stax: I mean, I'll take

363
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:20.900
Evan Martinez - Stax: a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of

364
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:25.710
Thomas: I think it a different, less rich guy that might be a little more comfortable. Yeah, yeah.

365
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:28.149
Joseph Howlett: yeah. Okay, so I I just like, I,

366
00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:45.629
Evan Martinez - Stax: I'm really glad that you you listened back on that audio, and that where you're able to talk about this in detail. I really like. I sorry I cut you off. Joke. No, I'm done. I I think it's it's time to turn to you. I I just wanted to highlight all these things, because I think the month of June is very important, and I don't want to lose track of that.

367
00:46:46.050 --> 00:47:03.510
Evan Martinez - Stax: The month of yeah, yeah, the month of June. And in particular, like the 2 weeks after. Sedona. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, yeah, I I I I I for sure feel better about finding a job now than I did before we went to Sedona. There's no question.

368
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:06.429
Evan Martinez - Stax: I don't know if it's because I was.

369
00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:20.089
Evan Martinez - Stax: I mean, I'm sure it's because of I'm you know, all of the cool things we did in Sedona for the podcast, the spiritual awakening, the astrologer coupled with the sort of

370
00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:42.450
Evan Martinez - Stax: the, the more structure and guidance that I've been getting over the past few days and weeks from pathrise that's really helped. So I I I for like there's no question I feel better about this. I I was getting pretty down about finding a job, and I still have moments right like it's not all the up and up all the time. I still have moments where it's like

371
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:45.220
Evan Martinez - Stax: I put in a lot of work on a resume

372
00:47:45.940 --> 00:48:07.120
Evan Martinez - Stax: and hit, submit. And then, like 4 days later, they tell me to go fuck myself because I'm like, I'm I literally everything in the job requirements is what I have done. but like the highs and the lows are a lot more evened out. So it's it's not, as like, you know, difficult a sort of path to climb.

373
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:13.979
Joseph Howlett: Have you thought back to the breathwork or the Raiki toe reading whatever recession at all.

374
00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:21.019
Evan Martinez - Stax: Have you thought back to the breathwork? We'll get to be on top out there?

375
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:32.480
Joseph Howlett: Well, I'm asking, because the breathwork wasn't particularly moving for you. You were into it, you you enjoyed it, but it wasn't particularly spiritually moving. What was the card you drew again before the breathwork.

376
00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:33.850
Oh, shit!

377
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:39.430
Thomas: I have no idea. I don't remember.

378
00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:40.659
Evan Martinez - Stax: I don't remember

379
00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:47.660
Evan Martinez - Stax:  The the Raiki I kind of thought, was just really more of a massage.

380
00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.780
Evan Martinez - Stax:  I

381
00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:56.110
Evan Martinez - Stax: He like read my toes. But I just I I like

382
00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:20.479
Evan Martinez - Stax: I I like to be honest. I really kind of checked out of that whole experience, like mentally, just because the guy was talking so much that it it turned me off a bit from the actual act of receiving a massage and like a ricky session. So when you like talked about my toes and I think predicted my future. I like I I just nothing registered with me.

383
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:35.659
Evan Martinez - Stax: The the breathwork, you know. I I don't know if I so would would agree with you that I did not have like a moving spiritual moment. I think I even talked about at the time of the class after how you you know.

384
00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:59.690
Evan Martinez - Stax: I mean, I I didn't. I didn't have as emotional as we of our. I didn't. I didn't. God damn! I'm studying! I didn't have as emotional a reaction as say, you and Tom, but I still had a really wonderful time, you know, and the imagery of like the little meat like coming down and chilling in my chest like was something I've never experienced. And and

385
00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:02.660
Evan Martinez - Stax: I felt really good, you know.

386
00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:17.520
Evan Martinez - Stax: but yeah, I guess I even I don't. Did you tell us about that? The little you coming down? And yeah, that was a whole, that was all. A part of the like the visualizations that Mrs. Hat like gave us all. And and I talked about it

387
00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:24.309
Evan Martinez - Stax: after like, when we were all sitting down, I do you think I have talked about it on Mike like after it? Do you think that meant anything.

388
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:28.800
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, I mean.

389
00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:30.660
Evan Martinez - Stax: well.

390
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.909
Evan Martinez - Stax: I think what it you know, I'm more interested to see sort of

391
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:39.409
Evan Martinez - Stax: how all of this plays out in the next, like 3, 6, 9, 12 months.

392
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:45.319
Evan Martinez - Stax: But what I what it could mean right is is like an an acceptance of more of like

393
00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:57.719
Evan Martinez - Stax: all of the childhood faults and the things that you know we deal with as kids, you know, maybe resolving some traumas that could be a little bit further. Push the need a little bit more.

394
00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:14.730
Evan Martinez - Stax: but it was, I mean more. It was just what I really enjoyed about. It was like just like the visualization of like a little mini, me hovering over my chest, and then like going inside, which is what she like, what she guided us to do. And I thought that was really cool.

395
00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:21.500
Joseph Howlett: Okay, Tom, do you have anything else to ask, Evan, before we move on to us?

396
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:27.410
Thomas: hold on! Let me unmute. I was doing temporary. Me.

397
00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:29.669
Thomas: There we go.

398
00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:35.370
Thomas:  yeah, I guess. So. This trip was

399
00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:48.290
Thomas: ostensibly about you. I don't know if the audience is cut on, but that was kind of a conceit right? We went to Sedona to do all this stuff, and it was like framed around your experience. But it was really about all of us, and about the whole world, and philosophy and spirituality, and

400
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.900
Thomas: you know that.

401
00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:57.340
Thomas: But sticking with the the little hook that we hung this story on

402
00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:01.239
Thomas: the original goal was to.

403
00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.169
Thomas: And there's a bus going by. Sorry.

404
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:07.429
Thomas: Also I had to stop my recording and start again.

405
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.130
That was me clapping

406
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:17.019
Evan Martinez - Stax: the the I don't know, unless Joey and I pick the clap up in our mics right like, does it do anything?

407
00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.239
Thomas: Well, it does in the zoom recording

408
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:37.360
Thomas: gotcha. Okay, it makes it a little easier. Yeah. Cause you know, we can sync everything to the zoom, and then it's all on one, Master Gotcha, and that makes it easier to line up. I don't know. It might be it could very well be a waste of time. I don't know it's certainly good if we're in the same room.

409
00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:40.690
Thomas:  so

410
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:49.070
Thomas: you know, essentially, the trip was about you, and seeing if we could unlock some part of your spiritual life. And you said to me in the past, and I think.

411
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.630
Thomas: just before.

412
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.590
Thomas: yeah, you said during

413
00:52:52.850 --> 00:53:01.689
Thomas: you said during our conversation before we went out here a little intervention for you that you don't really have a spiritual practice.

414
00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:03.030
Thomas: and

415
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:11.799
Thomas: you don't really see how it would add anything to your life. You're not opposed to it. But you just. It's not something you're particularly interested in

416
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:16.720
Thomas: now. My fucking cuckoo clock is going off.

417
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:19.100
Thomas: It's really something

418
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:25.400
Thomas: the conspiracy of

419
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.620
annoyance.

420
00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.140
What time is it? Okay?

421
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:47.260
Thomas: You know, we talked on our last day there about how you've kind of opened up a bit in that regard. And then there's also the whole thing where me and Joey were saying, we feel like there's this like kind of emotional depth

422
00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:51.190
Thomas: that we feel like it's hard to reach with you sometimes.

423
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:55.219
Thomas: Have your feelings about any of that stuff changed like? Do you think

424
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:58.440
Thomas: that the mission that Joey and I set out on

425
00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:02.230
Thomas: for you for this episode. Did it work?

426
00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:13.070
Evan Martinez - Stax:  yeah, I mean, I. The short answer is, I don't know.

427
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:16.879
Evan Martinez - Stax: You know a lot of

428
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:19.110
Evan Martinez - Stax: a lot of

429
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:23.190
Evan Martinez - Stax: or not a lot. But part of what you guys

430
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:24.630
Evan Martinez - Stax: were

431
00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:28.089
Evan Martinez - Stax: describing and hoping for are like.

432
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:33.089
Evan Martinez - Stax: only really seen in my interactions with you guys. And so

433
00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:39.930
Evan Martinez - Stax: you know, you let me know in the next, like 3 months, 6 months, 12 months.

434
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:44.309
Evan Martinez - Stax: If you notice a difference, you know I

435
00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:47.510
Evan Martinez - Stax: I think one of the

436
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:53.059
Evan Martinez - Stax: most exciting lessons I took from this trip is is

437
00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:58.809
Evan Martinez - Stax: just getting an understanding of the definition of spirituality.

438
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:06.610
Evan Martinez - Stax: because I was excited to learn that I do have a spiritual life. I just didn't realize it.

439
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:16.170
Evan Martinez - Stax:  And then also, there is the component of, you know, leaning more into it and and trying to expand on it, and with intention.

440
00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:22.709
Evan Martinez - Stax:  but yeah, to to answer your question like for the other stuff like I I I

441
00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:25.110
Evan Martinez - Stax: I mean?

442
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:35.680
Evan Martinez - Stax: I'm not sure. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not really clear on what your mission was in the trip. Besides, like

443
00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:41.870
Evan Martinez - Stax:  using it as an opportunity to to what's up?

444
00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:45.080
Thomas: Oh, yeah. Well, I think I could put it succinctly like

445
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:50.430
Thomas: the goal of the trip. The question that I wanted to answer was

446
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:58.870
Thomas: by going to Sedona and embracing all of the world of different kinds of spiritual practices there.

447
00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:01.899
Thomas: Can we

448
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:05.280
Thomas: unlock something for you

449
00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:09.909
Thomas: that is in the realm of spirituality. And if we can.

450
00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.900
Thomas: will that

451
00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:20.940
Thomas: help some of these other issues that you've been struggling with recently, or just? Maybe struggling is the wrong word but issues. You've had recently different kinds of difficulties.

452
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:29.989
Thomas:  is there any relationship between those things, and can we improve them all at once? So to me like the fact that

453
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:48.779
Thomas: you've already defined spirituality. And now it's something you're excited about. And at your house there's a bunch of crystals, and you pick them up and feel good and like that's that seems like a a pretty radical change. That was exactly the mission that we set out on here. I don't I? I want to ask about crystals in a second. But

454
00:56:48.800 --> 00:57:15.570
Thomas:  I think that's pretty wild. The fact that that shit worked. I didn't really think it was going to work, but it seems like it did. So. All this other stuff about, like, you know, we'll we'll be sad the way that Joey and I are sad together with us. That's maybe a separate issue. Maybe it's an issue that me and Joe we have, and not an issue that you have. I don't know. I I'm not sure I'm less sure than I was when we started. But spiritual stuff is a different thing.

455
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:22.390
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah. And to be clear like. I'm not picking up the crystals because I think they have actual power. I still don't know.

456
00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:29.280
Evan Martinez - Stax: but I'm willing to try what you know like. I don't pick up the crystals on my coffee table.

457
00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:30.440
Evan Martinez - Stax: And

458
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:57.800
Evan Martinez - Stax:  yeah, like I I I don't. I mean, I I still don't know if they do anything but again, like if the crystals don't. But there's a placebo effect that makes me feel good like that's something, and that's something that we've all talked about in the podcast as being just as legitimate. Right? So I'm I'm it's like a trial period, like, I mean, I'm, I'm checking it out. And I'm picking them up and

459
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:05.709
Evan Martinez - Stax: going about my life as normal without putting too much weight into any one of these individual activities. And in like.

460
00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:12.139
Evan Martinez - Stax: And then in like 3, 6, 12 months, you know. reassess, and see see what's going on.

461
00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:21.599
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, I I just thought that was an important point to clarify like I don't. I don't. But I don't know if these crystals are actually doing anything, but I'm still

462
00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:26.599
Evan Martinez - Stax: picking them up because I'm I don't know, and I'm fine to say that. You know.

463
00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:29.389
Thomas: I like the 2 aren't mutually exclusive. Obviously.

464
00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:35.949
Thomas: definitely let's let's harp on the crystals for a second, because we didn't really talk about it at all

465
00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.019
Thomas: in Sedona much.

466
00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:48.600
Thomas: but we've been living with them for a while. So we bought all these crystals, Evan. I got you one. I picked one out. I didn't buy it for you

467
00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:55.130
Thomas: that was supposed to help with your gastrointestinal problems. If you're going to use that one, I think you should hold it.

468
00:58:55.150 --> 00:59:01.039
Thomas: you know, when you're in the bathroom, I think it should be in your hand while you're praying to hope that things are going to work out for you.

469
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:04.759
Thomas: Wait. Is that? one of the smaller ones? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

470
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.599
Thomas: Oh, get him! Go get him! Let's all get our crystal. I don't grab mine.

471
00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:26.060
Evan Martinez - Stax: All

472
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:36.190
Thomas: okay. I grab my crystals. I've got 3 here that I bought in Sedona. One is a flat purple one. Here.

473
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:44.099
Thomas: One is sort of a more rectangular kind of clear. That sort of looks like courts, but I don't think it's chords.

474
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:51.920
Thomas: I don't know what any of these are, and here's like kind of a green one with brown specs. This looks like kind of a bathroom rock, but that's not what this was.

475
00:59:53.110 --> 01:00:05.470
Thomas: I've been picking them up and holding them in my hand, and like one of the things that we did, you know. Remember, when we went to that mountain? With that guide. What was her name? Joey? We did this.

476
01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:11.490
Thomas: you know. We went to that mountain with Kim. Yes, we moved to the mountain with.

477
01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:19.610
Thomas: you know we went to that mountain with Kim, and we did that whole ceremony at the Vortex, and she had us like visualizing energy.

478
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:24.709
Thomas: and I kind of like, let myself go and let myself think about that, and feel it, and not

479
01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:31.930
Thomas: really wonder about whether it's real or not, and kind of ignore that whole question, and just kind of think about and visualize.

480
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:39.990
Thomas: I don't even know what energy is in this context, like some kind of flowing. light sort of thing, and I peg up these crystals.

481
01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.929
Thomas: and I've been like kind of imagining that they're emanating some kind of

482
01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.360
Thomas: light, and I'm like picturing it like flowing through my fingers.

483
01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:52.140
Thomas: I don't know if it's doing anything. It's kind of fun.

484
01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.920
Thomas: Evan, when you

485
01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:02.710
Thomas: you said you're not sure if these things are real. Do you think you're taking them more seriously now than you would have before? Sedona?

486
01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.970
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, I think just by being more open to

487
01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:15.000
Evan Martinez - Stax: yeah to it means I'm taking it more seriously. But I don't know. Actually, are those 2 the same thing. I'm more open to it.

488
01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:31.900
Thomas:  yeah. So probably I'm taking. I see it less as a joke. I can say that for sure. You know it's the the whole crystal thing seems silly, I mean, Joey said. Between the 3 of us. We have almost a hundred years of not believing in crystals. Yeah.

489
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:37.859
Evan Martinez - Stax: I mean, I think it's like, only right that I that I still say that I'm

490
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.609
Evan Martinez - Stax: like crystals, I think are are

491
01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.799
Evan Martinez - Stax: an area of woo where I still feel

492
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.890
Evan Martinez - Stax: like most resistant.

493
01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:53.279
Evan Martinez - Stax: like. It's it's like crystals to me. Still, like.

494
01:01:53.510 --> 01:02:12.199
Evan Martinez - Stax: you know, it's still the. It's still like the furthest reaching kind of you know thing that we've done that I think we all did in Sedona, but I'm I'm much less closed off to it than I was. Yeah, yeah, like, the fact that I have them in my house is something

495
01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:16.259
Thomas: for me by far the hardest one for me

496
01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:27.600
Thomas: is the astrology for sure, which seems like the easiest ones for you guys like I was definitely blown away during the astrology session by

497
01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:40.269
Thomas: the level of accuracy of the things that that Guy was saying, both about you and in terms of dates of things happening in in your life, and we learned later that you weren't being totally forthcoming about how accurate he was with the dates.

498
01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:47.689
Thomas: me, yeah. During the session, like there was the thing like starting when you were aid and ending when you were 23 or something, and like

499
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:52.730
Evan Martinez - Stax: you did not. It's not that I wasn't being accurate with him. I just didn't want to bring in like.

500
01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.540
Thomas: yeah, you weren't. You weren't being misleading. You just didn't acknowledge

501
01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:15.799
Thomas: like how fucking crazy it was that he had gotten that right? Yeah. But still, I don't know why. There's just something with me where I'm like I like, how? By what mechanism would I? I just can't. I can't get my head around it. I don't know. I like that. And that's like, you know, the quintessential woo-woo

502
01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:19.759
Thomas: thing is astrology right like, if that's not it, I don't know what is.

503
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:21.759
Yeah, go ahead, Joe.

504
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:29.390
Joseph Howlett: He had never. I mean I listened to that. I he had never met Avon in his life.

505
01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:38.210
Joseph Howlett: and he said that in the first 5Â min he said that he prefers to be a boss than an employee. He wants to.

506
01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.949
Joseph Howlett: He wants he he wants to to work for himself.

507
01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:45.710
Joseph Howlett: He is very strong and practical minded.

508
01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:57.129
Joseph Howlett: And did anything bad happen to you around the age of 7 or 8 dramatic experiences. I mean, that's pretty weird, you know. And I

509
01:03:57.210 --> 01:04:13.410
Thomas: I I I hate to do this. I I hate to do it. But in any time Tom says I hate to do something. He's he's he. He can't wait to. No, no, it's not. It's not, it's not, it's not it. I mean, maybe a little bit

510
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:16.969
Thomas: It wasn't totally.

511
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:20.270
Thomas: It wasn't totally popular. Ra, so right? Because I had

512
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:36.860
Thomas: several phone calls with this guy where I described the project that we were on, and Evans resistance to spirituality, or my perception of Evans, resistance of spirituality, and that stuff. So he knew a bit. It wasn't totally clean to say that doesn't detract from

513
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:45.370
Thomas: all of the things that Joey just brought up, like the only one that maybe could be related is like him, wanting to be a boss, not an employee like

514
01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:50.170
Thomas: I can't remember whether I mentioned Evans. you know.

515
01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.580
Thomas: Teetering, scared up.

516
01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.950
Thomas: But what was that?

517
01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.279
Thomas: Yeah. Company? Yeah.

518
01:04:56.330 --> 01:05:03.369
Thomas: you said. Petering's time seatering, teetering like it. It it could teeter in one direction or a container and the other. You know it's dangerous.

519
01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:16.130
Thomas: something's teeter, and it's great, for you know, if you're teetering, and then you fall into the good hole like that's awesome.

520
01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:31.950
Thomas:  so I don't know like, but still it was still it was why, but it it it was a struggle for me. I mean one thing that I think, is interesting, that I noticed during this trip that, I think was more pronounced for me than ever before, was like looking at the way Joey engages with this stuff

521
01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:35.549
Thomas: where, like my impression, was like.

522
01:05:35.610 --> 01:06:00.639
Thomas: someone would be like, dragons are real, and joy be like, got it? Okay? Like dragons are real now and then, like he'd be like, All right, we gotta go do stuff, because now we know dragons are real. So like we have to like that changes everything, whereas, like, you know, the show's called, I want to believe. But I don't think any of us want to believe as bad as like. Joe is ready to believe he doesn't want to believe he's he's greased up.

523
01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:21.890
Joseph Howlett: Yeah, Evan would, Evan said frequently or implied frequently that this is to my detriment, and of course, like all of us, all of us think we're doing this in the right way, and the other 2 are doing it the wrong way. But like, but like that, it's true that that is definitely the the. If we're on the on that spectrum, I'm definitely at the extreme one. Yeah, which is interesting.

524
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:33.520
Thomas: And I did have there. There have been times, and this isn't my overall feeling. But just tell you all the things that I have thought at different moments. I thought like, that's not the right way to do this like that's not a journalistic project where, if you're like going in

525
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:40.760
Thomas: like, not with an agenda, but like like a truth that you want to arrive at

526
01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:59.440
Thomas: like makes it, you know, can kind of cloud a person's judgment. I I don't think that's how I actually feel, but that's like something that came up for me at moments. I don't know. I don't know what the right way to engage with this stuff is like, what is the project that we're doing? We just want to like, find out?

527
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.960
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, I mean, I

528
01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:06.270
Evan Martinez - Stax: I was going to say so. So I made a note in my phone.

529
01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:07.400
Thomas: Well.

530
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:13.849
Thomas: you guys ever been competitive with your dad, is it about kindergarten?

531
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:18.900
Evan Martinez - Stax: So yeah, like on the

532
01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.389
Evan Martinez - Stax: I. So I re-listed to.

533
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:30.159
Evan Martinez - Stax: I listened back on the final discussion. When we were. It was right after the breathwork, right? We were all sitting outside of my parents. Patio.

534
01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:35.210
Evan Martinez - Stax: Listen back through that whole thing. And

535
01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:50.220
Evan Martinez - Stax: so 1 one of the like one. All right, this is going to sound. It sounds it. It feels weird to say this. I want to preface this, but it feels weird to say this, but I'm going to say it because it was my feeling after listening to it some days later.

536
01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:54.240
Evan Martinez - Stax:  it it

537
01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:56.100
Evan Martinez - Stax: like

538
01:07:57.530 --> 01:07:58.450
Evan Martinez - Stax: when

539
01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:03.140
Evan Martinez - Stax: my takeaway was that it? It like sounded like

540
01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:07.170
Evan Martinez - Stax: Tom Slash Joe.

541
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:12.180
Evan Martinez - Stax:  I I prefer Tom, Joe.

542
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:31.270
Evan Martinez - Stax: yeah, it just it sounds. It's it's like. And this is on this very specific topic. that we talked about. And it it like it sounded like, you guys almost needed me to see the world, or like, have the world view of suffering or wanted me.

543
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:34.239
Evan Martinez - Stax: and, like the other takeaway was that

544
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:45.579
Evan Martinez - Stax: I love you, Tom, but you you kind of sounded like a bully after we listening to that in that final conversation, like a little bit like you were really fishing for.

545
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:56.450
Evan Martinez - Stax: like you wanted an answer out of me that you maybe weren't getting. Or maybe you were. Or maybe you were just trying to make great content. But I brought this up now.

546
01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:05.379
Evan Martinez - Stax: based off of what you said earlier, which is like I, you know. over the last 2 weeks since I've been back I have spent

547
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:11.430
Evan Martinez - Stax: a fair amount of time wondering, like how this trip would have gone if

548
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:19.830
Evan Martinez - Stax: we didn't have the preface that it was some kind of a competition of any kind. You know. I I like

549
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:37.630
Evan Martinez - Stax: I And it's not like even before the trip where we were joking about what this is. It's you guys trying to make me uncomfortable like the like, even these these jokey things like. And then and then the real, the the very real structure about this being like

550
01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:40.629
Evan Martinez - Stax: a spiritual

551
01:09:41.560 --> 01:10:01.590
Evan Martinez - Stax:  what's the thing called when you like? Get a drug addict in a room that you guys intervention. Thank you. Like, you know, even with the very real premise of this being a spiritual intervention for me, I still wonder, like what this could have been, or how could it have been different

552
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:15.699
Evan Martinez - Stax: if it was instead of that, like all 3 of us going in as equals? Now not to say that I would. I want to change anything, or that I would have, because I really enjoyed the premise. but it just like something that I think about, which is weird.

553
01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:19.010
Thomas: Well, you know, I

554
01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:25.009
Thomas: you know, with the help of a doctor, and easing off antidepressants, so kind of every

555
01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:28.650
Thomas: thing makes me sad right now, like everything I hear, I'm like, Oh, God! That's sad!

556
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:34.089
Thomas: But a lot of what you said makes me sad. A lot of what you just kind of makes me sad

557
01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:41.709
Thomas: for one like you. You brought this up during the trip like the idea of it being a competition and not wanting it to be a competition.

558
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:47.080
Thomas: It was never a competition for me. I never like. There were moments

559
01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.289
Thomas: when we were discussing it and having a debate

560
01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:58.270
Thomas: like where I was like trying to make a point. And I really wanted you to see my point. But that was in those moments

561
01:10:58.390 --> 01:11:02.810
Thomas: in the context of a particular discussion. I didn't

562
01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.529
Thomas: come into this.

563
01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:12.110
Thomas: you know, wanting to win. I came into this with an a question and an idea

564
01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:17.510
Thomas: like a thesis, I guess, and there was something that I wanted you to see.

565
01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:25.079
Thomas: And you know, during that conversation I will say like I was going much harder than I would in other conversations, because, like I,

566
01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:34.530
Thomas: I wanted good content. And I wanted in that moment with the Mics around for you to see the thing that I was saying, because if you got it a week later, we're not recording a discount.

567
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:40.990
Thomas: you know, so I think I like in terms of being a bully. I it bums me out that you felt that way. I I felt

568
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:46.270
Thomas: like you were getting really angry at me during it, and it it bummed me out at the time.

569
01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:49.259
Thomas:  that could have been me projecting.

570
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:52.030
Evan Martinez - Stax: No, I remember you saying that. Yeah.

571
01:11:54.760 --> 01:12:01.680
Evan Martinez - Stax: yeah, don't. I mean, don't feel bad like you were going for good content. And that's something. I think we all want

572
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:06.129
Evan Martinez - Stax:  and and like to be clear. You, weren't you? Huh?

573
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:09.199
Thomas: That's one god we all worship. Yeah.

574
01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:23.730
Evan Martinez - Stax:  It was only at like particular moments, and it was probably just during the times like you said where you were pushing a lot harder than you normally would have right that it that I that I got that feeling.

575
01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:31.909
Evan Martinez - Stax: But it wasn't like. It's not a strong like. I'm not angry, like I'm not angry. Right? It's it's all good like. Don't don't worry about it.

576
01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:33.529
Thomas: I'll try.

577
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:39.790
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, I could say something.

578
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:42.550
Joseph Howlett: Time. You guys on me?

579
01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:45.220
Thomas: No, no, I I want to hear what you have.

580
01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.820
Thomas: I might.

581
01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:48.740
It's a it

582
01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.379
Joseph Howlett: at some point. at some point, Evan, you'll listen to the call Tom and I had.

583
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:59.710
Joseph Howlett: and some of them were recorded. Some weren't. But

584
01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:03.569
Joseph Howlett: I mean we talked about this, and

585
01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:09.070
Joseph Howlett: I think you're totally right, Evan. that that is

586
01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:10.930
Joseph Howlett: the tenor it took on.

587
01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:13.040
Joseph Howlett: and I also wonder

588
01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:19.880
Joseph Howlett: what it would be like otherwise. But I don't think, looking back, that it could have been otherwise.

589
01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:23.240
Joseph Howlett: because because I

590
01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:25.740
Joseph Howlett: the truth is that

591
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:30.250
Joseph Howlett: the trip happened because Tom and I think something about you

592
01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:39.629
Joseph Howlett: like we have this image of you which is flawed, and then we have this image of what you could use, or what you could benefit from, which is also flawed.

593
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:48.360
Joseph Howlett: But the point is that you did disagree with those images like when we presented to you our kind of thesis

594
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:52.169
Joseph Howlett: from the beginning. It wasn't something that you really felt

595
01:13:52.530 --> 01:14:02.880
Joseph Howlett: to be true. It wasn't something that rang very true to you, and that meant that there was something contentious or resistive or combative

596
01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:14.190
Joseph Howlett: about the nature of this project I think that maybe it was impossible to avoid. I would love. I'm trying to think about the version of that trip that is about Evan.

597
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:15.500
Joseph Howlett: but

598
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:22.330
Joseph Howlett: isn't in competition with Devon. And I think it's impossible

599
01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:27.550
Joseph Howlett: because of the type of person you are like, because of what I am

600
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:38.210
Evan Martinez - Stax: also yeah for sure. But also like it's, it's something like, we're, we're making a podcast. We're, we're creating a story. And so like the the tension

601
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:43.319
Evan Martinez - Stax: as little or as much as there was right. The tension that

602
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:55.040
Evan Martinez - Stax: the tenor of this like this structure provided was also necessary for good storytelling. In my opinion, right like it was like, it's because

603
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:57.680
Evan Martinez - Stax: there, if we.

604
01:14:57.870 --> 01:15:19.570
Evan Martinez - Stax: if we, the version where we all go to Sedona and just have, like our own independent experiences and like nobody's pushing anybody to do anything like. That's not a story, I know, but that's not about Evan. So like, I'm wondering, is there? And is there a version of this episode. That's about Evan, but isn't contentious, and I think

605
01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:35.270
Joseph Howlett: not just us. We made that impossible because of because of making jokes like, oh, this is an intervention, right? That was a misstep in that direction that made that impossible, and you also made it impossible, because when you presented these facets of your character to you, you fundamentally disagreed that they were there.

606
01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.410
Evan Martinez - Stax: Can you? Can you say more on that?

607
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:43.720
Joseph Howlett: That? Spirituality is a thing which you are missing have particular difficulty engaging with

608
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:49.239
Thomas: more than us, and could benefit from. I mean, I'll say, like.

609
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:52.839
Thomas: when we went into that first conversation with you about this trip.

610
01:15:53.730 --> 01:16:01.199
Thomas: My memory was that Joey and I have brought up the idea that you are resistant to spiritual stuff

611
01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:14.219
Thomas: several times, and you've argued that that's not true. But then I felt like during that conversation you said, Yeah, it is kind of true, like I would expect of the 3 of us going into a project because I would be the most resistant. I never heard you say something like that.

612
01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.360
Thomas: So I, you know.

613
01:16:19.190 --> 01:16:23.209
Thomas: thinking about what you said. Yeah, I think I was a little competitive

614
01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:29.030
Thomas: about this project. I mean, part of it was like, you know, we've talked about this before.

615
01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:34.479
Thomas: This kind of thing. you know, separate from our work on the show.

616
01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:36.960
Thomas: and like come to an impasse.

617
01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:43.240
Thomas: You know. I remember that time we were like doing our little radio show thing, and we were lying on my rug, and we talked about it.

618
01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:45.529
Thomas: And like, you know, it's

619
01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.860
Thomas: it's hard for me for a number of reasons. One is, it's like. you know, there's

620
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:59.649
Thomas: something that's really important to me that I believe that I want to get across to you because I care about you

621
01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:01.070
Thomas: the thing that that

622
01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.400
fucking truck going by.

623
01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:13.019
Thomas: the thing that that is is about the nature of our relationship, and this kind of long yearning that I felt.

624
01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:22.290
Thomas: you know, with you, and I think with, you know, a lot of other people of like wanting this level of intimacy that I felt like I couldn't have, which I think is a me problem. I you problem

625
01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:24.400
Thomas: so like that.

626
01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:27.760
Thomas: That's rough, you know, like, when we.

627
01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:37.040
Thomas: you know, did our breathwork ceremony at the end, like one of the things. I was really mad at you, and I don't know if I told you that

628
01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:57.530
Thomas: before we end our breath at the end of breathwork at the beginning. Oh, no, I had no idea why, during the ceremony I forgave you, and felt better, and understood how I shouldn't be mad. What like do right before the ceremony you were like. Let's make this 10Â min, because I think it's going to be bad and like, I want to

629
01:17:57.610 --> 01:18:06.789
Thomas: like, get out of here, basically. And I was like, Come the fuck on like we have to engage with this. try and like it. We had had a similar conversation

630
01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:13.940
Thomas: the day before where you were like, you know, when we get back to the house like, let's just do like 10Â min. Everybody's tired, and I'm like no like

631
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:20.059
Thomas: one of the things that I arrived at during the thing during the ceremony was like.

632
01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:22.510
Thomas: you know, if

633
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:35.709
Thomas: I was so mad. Because I'm like we're doing work here. We're not relaxing, and it's hard. It's hard work, and it takes a lot of work. And like, if you can't do it, if it's like guys.

634
01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:42.860
Thomas: I'm in a terrible mood. I cannot do this, that's one thing. But if it's possible, like I feel like not feeling like it

635
01:18:42.880 --> 01:19:08.810
Thomas: like that's what it felt to me. It felt like you were saying, I don't really feel like doing this, so I was just. I was just tired, probably, and and like when I'm acting foolish and saying dumb things like I have my friends call me out, which is what you did. Yeah, but also, like, I don't think it was appropriate for me to be mad at you. I think that had to do with a lot of my feelings about the project like one of the things that Anahata whispered to me. She whispered things to all of us during the ceremony was like.

636
01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:12.419
Thomas: you don't have to take care of everyone and everything

637
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:14.880
Thomas: which, like

638
01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:22.850
Thomas: I'm getting a little choked up thinking about that like I did feel this pressure. And I often like with this project, feel like.

639
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:31.109
Thomas: I want this to be good so badly. And I'm so worried that it won't be. And I'm so worried that if, like, I have this idea, if we don't

640
01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:39.540
Thomas: fix this problem or do this thing, it's going to be bad and like, I have to convince everyone like, please listen to me. I want it to be good. We got to do it this one way, which is.

641
01:19:40.450 --> 01:19:47.099
Thomas: you know, about a lot of different issues that I have about control, and

642
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:52.319
Thomas: you know confidence and trust in the people that I love. And

643
01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:56.849
Thomas: you know, faith, that things will work out, and the projects that I work on will be okay.

644
01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:00.620
Thomas: And also just like me.

645
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:05.330
Thomas: all of my relationships feeling so precarious all the time.

646
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:13.160
Thomas: you know, and I think that, like sometimes I said this after the ceremony, like manifest sometimes, is me being mad or controlling or

647
01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:17.260
Thomas: despondent. and I think a lot of that shit cropped up.

648
01:20:18.190 --> 01:20:24.189
Thomas: you know, during this trip, and also because the trip is about in some sense our relationship.

649
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:35.170
Thomas: You know that like that's like painful for me, and it's like this thing that I'm I'm trying to like. Wrestle like, please Ev, and love me is

650
01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.970
Thomas: part of what's going on.

651
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:38.400
Thomas: you know, which

652
01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.570
Thomas: I don't have to do, because

653
01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:50.490
Thomas: I know that you love me. It's just in moments that's really hard for me to except and believe

654
01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.760
Evan Martinez - Stax: it's a journey.

655
01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:55.950
Thomas: Yeah.

656
01:20:57.490 --> 01:21:00.899
Thomas: And yeah, you know, I I don't think it could have been

657
01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:07.340
Thomas: less competitive for all the reasons, Joe said, because I came to it with a competitive spirit.

658
01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:16.880
Thomas: I don't think you are competitive necessarily, but you like didn't agree with my thesis. you know. So there was this like inherent tension there.

659
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:28.440
Thomas: like if it wasn't the only other way I could see it. If it's if we went and we're like, Well, I haven't you like that it was like, I'm like, Oh, okay, cool. I don't know what else it could be.

660
01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:30.010
Thomas: but I do.

661
01:21:31.210 --> 01:21:35.920
Thomas: No, I mean it makes bricks good. I've been talking a lot, but like

662
01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.470
Thomas: I think, all of that made the trip kind of hard and painful at moments.

663
01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:43.770
Thomas: and

664
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:46.190
Thomas: like

665
01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:51.009
Thomas: what's like to me, I felt strain on our relationships during it.

666
01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.150
Evan Martinez - Stax: Oh, I mean.

667
01:21:53.240 --> 01:22:02.329
Evan Martinez - Stax: I would clarify and say, only at moments like, Yeah, the majority of the trip by far, like, not a question

668
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:03.460
Evan Martinez - Stax: was

669
01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:18.900
Evan Martinez - Stax: not strenuous at all like it was, I was just loving the time I was getting with you guys, you know, and like sharing the town that I grew up in with you. And so yeah, only for only but moments, in my opinion, at least.

670
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:30.169
Evan Martinez - Stax: where it was it strenuous, and that was like during the more like. you know, the more like, you know, like the breathwork at the end. Obviously.

671
01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:35.570
Evan Martinez - Stax:  But yeah, like only for moments. For me. Anyways, you know.

672
01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:44.699
Thomas: Yeah, I mean, I guess one thing I want to say is, I recognize that I made it a little slightly at moments.

673
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:50.040
Thomas: perhaps a little more unpleasant for you. and less fun than it could have been.

674
01:22:50.200 --> 01:23:01.510
Thomas: and I wish it could have been another way. But there, I'm sorry there was no other way for it to go. This is how it's going to I'm glad, because I think we got the best tape we could of it. It's good tape. It's good to. Yeah.

675
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:26.560
Joseph Howlett: I mean that suffering conversation is the best moment in the history of podcast and I'll, I'll die on that hill. The the conversations? No, the one I haven't listened back to. Yeah, yeah. I I'm afraid to listen to it, because I I was upsetting for me during okay, in your Ep, which is good, like.

676
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.450
Thomas: I love that I have to wrestle with something here that is hard and challenging

677
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:40.310
Thomas: in the ways that a lot of the emotional growth have been dealing with lately is, should we talk about me and Joey?

678
01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:43.129
Thomas: I

679
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:49.430
Thomas: I guess I could go first, because I've already started, you know, like, I mean, one interesting thing is like, I

680
01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.589
Thomas: I don't know if you guys notice this.

681
01:23:52.290 --> 01:23:54.229
Thomas: but I I think

682
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:56.490
Thomas: I have a lot of intense emotions.

683
01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.170
Thomas: Yeah.

684
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:05.080
Thomas: the emotions I've been having lately have been less intense than others have

685
01:24:05.150 --> 01:24:11.099
Thomas: had for a while, you know, like I went through like a really difficult break up

686
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:15.299
Thomas: about a year ago now, almost exactly, actually. And it took

687
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:20.770
Thomas: a really long time to get through it.

688
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:27.600
Thomas: I think, because it was also about of a lot of other things. And I've actually over the past couple of months like, I'm

689
01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:37.870
Thomas: totally better. I was doing a lot better. Now, I think things are good, and I actually have this feeling now, like I spent most of a year being like I have to escape

690
01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:43.580
Thomas: this period, like I need to get to a place where I'm not suffering this much every day.

691
01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:48.780
Thomas: And now I did, and that was like the primary focus of my life. And now I'm like.

692
01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:58.879
Thomas: well, now, what do I like? What am I working on? You know, like everything feels kind of aimless and like going into this trip. I was talking.

693
01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.920
Thomas: I guess. Let's get.

694
01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:17.010
Thomas: I like it. When podcasts get real, let's get real, should we get real guys what the fuck has this bid? I'm not. I don't know. If I'm ready for real, I think. you know, I had an idea for a podcast called, Let's go there.

695
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:28.359
Thomas: You know, I, before the trip, agreed with my psychiatrist that I needed to make a major change with all of the pills that I'm taking, and I put it off

696
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:41.180
Thomas: because I didn't want to be going through that during the trip, like it was right before the trip that, we decided, and he gave me a new prescription. And then, right after I tried it. And then, like, Now I'm like

697
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:48.250
Thomas: off all those medications, and I'm like going through withdrawals. My body's like there used to be a lot of serotonin here like there's not, and

698
01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:49.939
Thomas: we are not pleased about it.

699
01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:58.909
Thomas:  So it's weird. It's hard for me to think about like how that trip affected me. It was huge. I mean, it really changed my thinking about

700
01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:05.469
Thomas: just like you have, and what spirituality is, and what it means to me, and what are the ways I can practice it.

701
01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:11.289
Thomas:  I had, you know, a really intense with that.

702
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:14.140
Thomas: you know. Breath work ceremony like

703
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:16.900
Thomas: like psychedelic

704
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:25.179
Thomas: journey, you know, and that's what Anna Huta calls them. She calls them journeys, and like. That's how it felt for me.

705
01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:34.010
Thomas: it's just been a crazy time, like a lot of shit like moving around and changing and like is in flux.

706
01:26:34.110 --> 01:26:39.289
Thomas: You know, I haven't really been in a place where I can like sit and contemplate.

707
01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:47.909
Thomas: you know, a slow, quiet change, because everything else is spinning around. But it was huge. I think it was. You know.

708
01:26:48.850 --> 01:26:54.120
Thomas: You know you come to some turning points in your life where you like. Make a 1 80 or like a hard right?

709
01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:58.810
Thomas: I think it was a turning point. I don't think it was a huge one

710
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:01.660
Thomas: waiting for a bus to go by.

711
01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:05.420
Thomas: I gotta figure out a better recording situation.

712
01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.559
Evan Martinez - Stax: maybe recording your your on your couch. I should. Yeah.

713
01:27:10.590 --> 01:27:16.290
Thomas: just away from the windows, you know. Yeah, it's just the desk is the issue. But I

714
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:17.410
Thomas: and

715
01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:21.479
Thomas: yeah, I don't think my life

716
01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:29.850
Thomas: is like different before and after. But I think it's different in a little way, like I think I like turn it like turn just a little bit. It's like things could be like this.

717
01:27:29.970 --> 01:27:32.070
Thomas: you know. You can be having

718
01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:37.130
Thomas: spiritual experience in all kinds of different ways. To me, coming out of that trip.

719
01:27:37.570 --> 01:27:39.600
Thomas: I thought spirituality

720
01:27:40.090 --> 01:27:41.190
Thomas: was

721
01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:43.430
Thomas: some kind of

722
01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:57.059
Thomas: religious or quasi-religious thing that relates to the frame of mind that people who are religious have right, even if it's not about believing in God. It's about some faith-based system.

723
01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:00.159
Thomas: In some kind of practice where.

724
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:06.029
Thomas: based on the conversations that we had and the conversations we had with.

725
01:28:06.130 --> 01:28:09.199
Thomas: you know all the different guides, and I think

726
01:28:09.330 --> 01:28:11.490
Thomas: Yukawa in particular.

727
01:28:12.690 --> 01:28:16.410
Thomas: Now, I think spirituality is

728
01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:18.999
Thomas: a way of

729
01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:29.420
Thomas: thinking about the world that's about feelings of connection and

730
01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:33.679
Thomas: oneness with other people in your environment and hearing this like

731
01:28:34.030 --> 01:28:39.520
Thomas: I can feel myself 10 years ago rolling my eyes. you know, but

732
01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.999
Thomas: like it's just like this intuitive

733
01:28:42.210 --> 01:28:45.710
Thomas: feeling of lighting things be the way they are and feeling

734
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:48.090
Thomas: things. And you like.

735
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:53.870
Evan Martinez - Stax: go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah, like, we're a so like a single organism.

736
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:58.100
Thomas: Yeah, I mean, as you take you take mushrooms, you're going to think about that.

737
01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.410
Thomas: you know.

738
01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:08.530
Thomas: yeah. And like feeling part of your environment which is hard to feel in, you know, this

739
01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:10.009
Thomas: beat up apartment

740
01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:14.760
Thomas: in Brooklyn, you know, it's not a very, not a lot of nature.

741
01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:21.489
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, Joe, real quick before you go. One of the most impactful statements that

742
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:26.010
Evan Martinez - Stax: for me, I heard out of any of our guides was when you, Koala.

743
01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.649
Evan Martinez - Stax: talked about walking outside.

744
01:29:28.810 --> 01:29:46.479
Evan Martinez - Stax: touching the little stem of the plant just to remind him and feel grounded to the earth. And then he, like, walked back into his meeting, or whatever it was, and was like good to go, just like the illustration of how nuanced and small spirituality can be

745
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:47.540
Evan Martinez - Stax: was

746
01:29:47.670 --> 01:29:54.780
Evan Martinez - Stax: so clear after he said, that I really I loved when he, when he said that like that was such a

747
01:29:54.950 --> 01:30:04.330
Evan Martinez - Stax:  What was that? It was? It was such a beautiful

748
01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:06.280
Evan Martinez - Stax: in simple statement.

749
01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:10.040
Evan Martinez - Stax: with so much power behind. It is what I remember feeling.

750
01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:12.460
Thomas: Yeah, like.

751
01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:17.849
Thomas: I remember that that moment stuck out to me, too. It's just like spirituality is about feeling

752
01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:23.120
Thomas: grounded and connected with everything around you, which is not

753
01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:41.990
Thomas: the way that our society is constructed to make you feel like everything is about rugged individualism and working really hard to earn things as opposed to just like here we all are. Isn't it strange? Yeah. And it was a potted plant. It wasn't even planted in the ground. It was in a pot.

754
01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:47.240
Evan Martinez - Stax: Joe, you want to go.

755
01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:50.510
Joseph Howlett: Yeah.

756
01:30:52.570 --> 01:30:54.580
Joseph Howlett: First. My crystal thing.

757
01:30:55.070 --> 01:31:00.870
Thomas: This is my crystal. Yeah, Joe, how's what's been your story with the crystals?

758
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:06.650
Joseph Howlett: So it's one of the reasons I wanted to get us together, did I? Actually? I

759
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.560
Joseph Howlett: I

760
01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:18.099
Joseph Howlett: So I have all sort of colitis. And that's what I asked. At the second crystal shop we went to where they wouldn't let us record.

761
01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:31.089
Joseph Howlett: I went to the cashier, and I said, I have all sort of colitis, and she pulled out a big book, and she went to the index, and she proceeded to give me a list of crystals that would help me.

762
01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:39.829
Joseph Howlett: and I I picked the one that was like most on the nose. And I picked a really pretty one that I love. It's like green and jagged. I described it when I bought it

763
01:31:40.210 --> 01:31:43.790
Joseph Howlett: on Mike. and

764
01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:51.690
Joseph Howlett: then I got. Then I went to Cape Cod for a week with my family, and I left it here. and I ate raw shellfish every day for a full week.

765
01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:56.269
Joseph Howlett: Everything was fine, it was fantastic. I came home.

766
01:31:56.540 --> 01:32:10.739
Joseph Howlett: and the first day at work I I saw the the crystal on my shelf. I'd put it near my bed, and I was like, maybe I'll just like care. It's small. Put in my pocket for the day, Lisa, at the first crystal shop. It said, some people like to do that.

767
01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:22.340
Joseph Howlett:  So I carried it around for the day, you know. I went to work. I was tired. I came home and went out to get Tacos.

768
01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:26.689
Joseph Howlett: I picked up 3 3 tacos. I brought them home.

769
01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:37.619
Joseph Howlett: and then I took everything out of my pocket, and I think this is important. At that moment, when I came in the door, I took everything out of my pocket, including the crystal. I sat down, I watched TV. I ate the 3 to it goes. I went to bed.

770
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:41.139
Joseph Howlett: This was Monday. This was this Monday night.

771
01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.119
Joseph Howlett: and I woke up at like 3 Am. With food poisoning.

772
01:32:46.240 --> 01:33:07.059
Joseph Howlett: and I spent the entire next 24Â h doing the things that you do when you have food poisoning. It was really, really awful. And I like, basically like, couldn't move. I couldn't even like open my phone to email work that I wouldn't be there like I just I, it was horrible. And

773
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:18.279
Joseph Howlett: for it for a full day. And then and then I noticed at some point during that day I saw the crystal on the floor. I was like, I guess. I took it in my pocket. It fell on the floor.

774
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:27.350
Joseph Howlett: so I don't know. and that that's not even the end of the story, like I didn't keep fucking with the crystal that week. The crystal kind of stayed on the floor.

775
01:33:27.450 --> 01:33:42.279
Joseph Howlett: But then, like I thought food poisoning was over. But it didn't. It triggered a colitis flare up. So I basically the upshot that, like those the 5 pistachios I shoved in my mouth before this record, so I wouldn't be angry.

776
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:50.930
Joseph Howlett: That's the first thing I've eaten since Monday. That isn't like a liquid, or saltines, or apple sauce.

777
01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:54.129
Joseph Howlett: and it's been a really bad week.

778
01:33:54.340 --> 01:34:01.359
Joseph Howlett:  And I don't know what to make of the fact that I was fine in all of Cape Cod.

779
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:30.940
Joseph Howlett: eating all these shellfish, and and and then I you know the 3 Tacos, but it's like the 3 Tacos were on the day that I was carrying the crystal around so like what the fuck, but then I did take it out of my pocket before I ate the 3 Tacos, so I I I don't know. What to make of it. Maybe crystals are nothing, and and there's nothing to make of it. I don't. I don't know but it's it's the work I mean. It's the worst week in terms of my disease that I've had in about a year.

780
01:34:31.930 --> 01:34:32.590
Hmm.

781
01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:36.250
Thomas: hold on.

782
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:40.220
Thomas: Yeah. I mean about the crystals, like.

783
01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:46.429
Thomas: if there's anyone left listening to our show at this point, who is a

784
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.550
Thomas: skeptical. we person

785
01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:56.409
Thomas:  this will probably sound annoying. but, like, you know, we talk about the placebo effect

786
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:57.260
like

787
01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:58.910
Thomas: are the crystals

788
01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:14.080
Thomas: like, if you believe that they'll help you. Will they help you? There's even like a placebo effect, where, even if you know a Pelosi, something is a placebo it can still help like if you tell they've done these clinical trials right where you tell someone I'm going to give you a placebo. This is not a real drug.

789
01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.250
Thomas: We're studying colitis. This is not going to help.

790
01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.950
Thomas: but it's supposed to, but it won't.

791
01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.360
Thomas: It still works.

792
01:35:23.170 --> 01:35:34.939
Thomas: So maybe that's some kind of scientific thing. Yeah, sure. But I also think that there is like a way you can be in touch with your body. and which has to do with being calm

793
01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:42.269
Thomas: and like present, and not like thinking really hard about things that might happen in the future, or it did happen in the past.

794
01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:47.169
Thomas: And like, I think you know, when I pick up these crystals.

795
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:59.439
Thomas:  I think it makes me feel that way. You know, this one right here. This feels like probably the one that I need to this guys. It's like it's kind of green.

796
01:35:59.890 --> 01:36:05.569
Thomas: Got some like brown in it. It's a weird shape. It's like, sort of a triangle.

797
01:36:06.130 --> 01:36:09.100
Thomas:  this is.

798
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:16.829
Thomas: It is. This is Eukonite, according to the sign at the Crystal Store. And what it's supposed to help with is heart-based. Knowing this.

799
01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:20.239
Thomas: it's the relationship stone it promotes psychic vision.

800
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:25.230
Thomas: It balances emotions, facilitates, rebirthing and past like healing, healing.

801
01:36:25.770 --> 01:36:27.520
Thomas: And you know for what it's worth.

802
01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:32.349
Thomas:  when we had our psychic reading

803
01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:39.689
Thomas: actually told us that I need to work on opening my heart shock where this little rock is supposed to help with that

804
01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.900
Thomas: I'd forgotten all of that shit

805
01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:48.180
Thomas: when I picked up these crystals in like belt them, but they make me feel relaxed.

806
01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:54.439
Thomas: That's got to help with shit, you know. If if you pick up that crystal, and it makes you feel calm, Joey, that probably helps with the colitis.

807
01:36:55.660 --> 01:37:11.149
Joseph Howlett: Well, I I mean, I I think I'm gonna get rid of mine like I feel like it's mocking me like I really. How how more could I have engaged with it like I put it in my fucking pocket and carried around today thinking about okay, you know, this day might be challenging for my whatever. And

808
01:37:11.210 --> 01:37:17.889
Joseph Howlett: then I got the, you know. Then I got really, really, really sick. And you know, looking at it now, it's making me kind of mad. Honestly.

809
01:37:18.010 --> 01:37:27.619
Thomas: Wait. I thought it was fine when you were in cake cod eating fish, and then you took it out of your pocket, and then you got sick. No, I didn't have it in Cape Cod. I left it here.

810
01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:35.639
Joseph Howlett: and I carried it. I carried it around. I got back. I carried it around for one day I got tacos. I brought them home and I got food poisoning.

811
01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.919
Evan Martinez - Stax: I mean you had

812
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:46.080
Evan Martinez - Stax: your your colitis is like an at like a it. It is a medically diagnosed disease.

813
01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:55.980
Evan Martinez - Stax: you know, and it's so often. I hear from homeopathic doctors or other people in the Google community that say, this stuff should be

814
01:37:56.090 --> 01:38:04.240
Evan Martinez - Stax: like it should work with Western medicine when you're dealing with, you know, things like this. So

815
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:12.090
Evan Martinez - Stax: the idea that just holding a crystal in your pocket would cure your colitis is insane.

816
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:13.969
Evan Martinez - Stax: It's nuts

817
01:38:14.230 --> 01:38:15.570
Thomas: unless they're magic.

818
01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:28.070
Evan Martinez - Stax: And then the but what I else I wanted to say is like, Yeah, if crystals, maybe crystals aren't your thing anymore. And that's fine, right? We're not going to resonate with all of the different

819
01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:41.149
Evan Martinez - Stax: practices and experiences and like options that the wool has to offer, and so like. If this is no longer something that tickles your fancy like. Fuck it, drop it. I just think of this one is bullshit.

820
01:38:41.170 --> 01:38:54.289
Thomas: Yeah, it sounds like you said it is mocking you. It doesn't sound like you think that it doesn't have any power. You think that it's it's in this rock is intentionally

821
01:38:54.290 --> 01:39:13.899
Joseph Howlett: being your life works. Yeah, I'm I'm throwing it out the window. But then it might poison somebody. I need to do something. Anyway, you need to dispose of it in the proper way.

822
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:23.740
Joseph Howlett: okay, so that's my first thing. And and I think the crystal discussion in it is good because it could go in the the next episode.

823
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:25.969
Joseph Howlett: Maybe. Yeah.

824
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:29.150
Joseph Howlett: the second thing is more.

825
01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:35.439
Thomas: Yeah. So I was, especially if the crystal thing comes after the stone episodes like. So when we were in Sedona, we got all these. Yeah.

826
01:39:35.670 --> 01:39:40.159
Joseph Howlett: yeah, it's perfect. Okay, the second thing is more about

827
01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:42.350
Joseph Howlett: this. So

828
01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:46.570
Joseph Howlett: you know, I had this big reaction to the breathwork.

829
01:39:46.810 --> 01:39:53.700
Joseph Howlett: I tried to like, you know, and like, I told you guys, it didn't have really specific content. So it was hard to like figure out what it meant.

830
01:39:53.900 --> 01:40:05.179
Joseph Howlett: So, you know, like I talked about it in therapy the next week, and I did. my sister read my Tarot in Cape Cod, and I I asked about it like what it meant.

831
01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:18.129
Joseph Howlett:  and my shrink. I you know, I told my trick. I was like, Yeah, no, I just like don't understand why. And my trick was like I mean, it makes total sense. Why, you got this reaction like she was like, you know, a according according to her

832
01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:24.080
Joseph Howlett: a bunch of stuff we've been working on in therapy totally relates, and it makes a lot of sense that I had this kind of big reaction.

833
01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:28.610
Joseph Howlett: knowing when that happens. Yeah.

834
01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:36.230
Joseph Howlett: you know. Then in Cape Cod, it kind of made me feel the terror reading. I'm still unpacking, but I think

835
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:44.270
Joseph Howlett: I think a lot of this, you know that. But the card I drew is new growth, and

836
01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:46.550
Joseph Howlett: I've been thinking about that a lot.

837
01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:51.790
Joseph Howlett:  I think that

838
01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:56.309
Joseph Howlett: I think that the choices I'm making in my life.

839
01:40:56.870 --> 01:41:03.910
Joseph Howlett: It feels to me it's always felt to me like there's like the personal stuff which is important. And then the work stuff, which is unimportant.

840
01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.579
Joseph Howlett: but it feels like kind of like in or like the kind of the

841
01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:12.519
Joseph Howlett: there's the real stuff I've always felt like. There's the real stuff and the superficial stuff.

842
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:23.800
Joseph Howlett:  but it in terms of those kind of superficial, logistical choices in my life. I think I've been making, or I am making ones that

843
01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:32.690
Joseph Howlett: really stake out a path of my own in a way that's new for me, and maybe challenging to that part of me that is really

844
01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:43.540
Joseph Howlett:  formed by my past and reactive to

845
01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:45.370
Joseph Howlett: these changes.

846
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:58.369
Joseph Howlett: So I don't know. I I that's me trying to understand the

847
01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:00.209
Joseph Howlett: my reaction to the breathwork.

848
01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:04.570
Thomas: Yeah, you know.

849
01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:10.000
Thomas: year and a half ago, 2 years ago, when did we start working on this?

850
01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.300
Thomas: I think it was in 2021, right?

851
01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.889
Evan Martinez - Stax: We yeah. We. We went hunting for my scooter in 2,021.

852
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:19.100
Yeah.

853
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:21.619
Thomas: And then we decided to.

854
01:42:22.730 --> 01:42:25.799
Thomas: you know, year and a half ago, 2 years ago, we decided to

855
01:42:26.130 --> 01:42:33.350
Evan Martinez - Stax: make this show about spirituality. Wait, Tom, if you're going to change subjects, can I ask Joey one question about what he said.

856
01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.500
Thomas: Oh, yeah, for

857
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:40.179
Evan Martinez - Stax: Joe, I'm I'm wondering. How do you see spirituality

858
01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:46.039
Evan Martinez - Stax: working with like therapy

859
01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:48.930
Evan Martinez - Stax: and childhood trauma like, how do you?

860
01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:54.349
Evan Martinez - Stax: How? How are those 2 practices merged inside of you like, what do you

861
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:59.989
Evan Martinez - Stax: is there? Is there any overlap? Is there like, I'm just curious, like.

862
01:43:00.810 --> 01:43:10.219
Evan Martinez - Stax: maybe this? Do you also use spirituality as a way to overcome childhood trauma? Or is it something totally separate? Do you ever, you know, like, I'm just curious like, how do those 2 like

863
01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:13.069
Evan Martinez - Stax: things exist within you?

864
01:43:13.330 --> 01:43:17.199
Joseph Howlett: Yeah, it's all one thing for sure, like complete overlap.

865
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:21.020
Joseph Howlett: like I I

866
01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:26.959
Joseph Howlett: there's a part of me which is which I think of as spirit

867
01:43:28.270 --> 01:43:29.959
Joseph Howlett: or spiritual.

868
01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:37.870
Joseph Howlett: and that is the part of me that's at play when I'm having an intimate conversation with friends

869
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:42.800
Joseph Howlett: when I'm in therapy, when I'm

870
01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:49.300
Joseph Howlett: doing actual spiritual practices. it's the same part of me

871
01:43:55.630 --> 01:43:56.950
that was it, Tom? Go ahead, man.

872
01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:03.930
Thomas: I just barped really loud. You guys couldn't hear it, but it is on

873
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:06.520
Thomas: my end. So that'll that'll be a treat for later.

874
01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:14.409
Thomas: So, like a year and a half ago, 2 years ago, we started working on this podcast.

875
01:44:14.830 --> 01:44:18.940
Thomas: And the idea. essentially right was.

876
01:44:19.330 --> 01:44:20.580
Thomas: we're all

877
01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:29.069
Thomas: barely skeptical, sometimes cynical people. We were even more so in the past right like not believing in

878
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:38.469
Thomas: spirituality and religion and all things. Woo was one of the key components of my identity for a really long time.

879
01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:40.830
Thomas: and we decided to work on this.

880
01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:42.070
and

881
01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:47.030
Thomas: as part of that, I like decided to

882
01:44:47.490 --> 01:44:49.930
Thomas: engage and be open-minded to it.

883
01:44:50.490 --> 01:45:01.629
Thomas: and over the course of the last year and a half I've gone through some of the most profound changes that I ever had in my entire life. And one of the things that's changed

884
01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:03.480
Thomas: is.

885
01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:08.609
Thomas: I absolutely have a spiritual life now

886
01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:11.120
Thomas: in a way that I never thought that I would.

887
01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:15.299
Thomas: and I think that was solidified

888
01:45:15.850 --> 01:45:19.290
Thomas: during the experiences that we had in Sedona.

889
01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:21.300
Thomas: and I would not have guessed

890
01:45:21.490 --> 01:45:30.470
Thomas: when we started working on the this project. that that was going to be the outcome was that we were going to come out the other side of this, and I'm like, no, a lot of this shit's real.

891
01:45:32.050 --> 01:45:33.550
Thomas: I think it is.

892
01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:40.340
Thomas: I don't know what real means anymore. Though I'm I'm more confused about that than I am about spirituality.

893
01:45:42.210 --> 01:45:43.480
Yeah, it's a good point

894
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:52.449
Thomas: we got anything else to say. Is there anything else like? Let's let's assume we're never going to talk about Sedona on a microphone ever again.

895
01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.959
Joseph Howlett: I got 2 quick questions for Evan.

896
01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:02.659
Joseph Howlett: Oh. are you a more spiritual person than you were before? The Sedona trip

897
01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:16.880
Evan Martinez - Stax: does, doing the things I was doing before. but with intention, count as being more spiritual.

898
01:46:17.730 --> 01:46:21.819
Thomas: do you think? Yeah, I think the key is that it does

899
01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:31.100
Thomas: you? Kuala said that it does right great and sure, yeah. I'm more open to it. Yeah. Also, I'd say that like.

900
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.250
Thomas: is it making you feel like you're doing? Let's say you're doing the same things

901
01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:40.029
Thomas: most of the same things.

902
01:46:40.170 --> 01:46:45.299
Thomas: Are you. Do you feel differently about them now that you have this context in this framing.

903
01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:52.160
Thomas: because that so like last but

904
01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:55.449
Evan Martinez - Stax: so like last night.

905
01:46:55.630 --> 01:47:01.990
Evan Martinez - Stax: I said my little thing to my parents and my brother right that I love all of them before going to bed.

906
01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:05.949
Thomas: Could you explain it again? Just in case this is the one we want to use, and we don't want to use others.

907
01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:10.969
Evan Martinez - Stax: So last last night, as I was saying, I love you to

908
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:19.169
Evan Martinez - Stax: my whole entire immediate family, which I I try to do every night before going to bed. I just say to myself in my head.

909
01:47:19.330 --> 01:47:23.450
Evan Martinez - Stax: unless I'm really really high. Then I'll say it out loud, because I think they're in the room with me.

910
01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:51.899
Evan Martinez - Stax:  you'd say, like, I love you, mom, I love you, Dad. Yeah, I'll say it out a lot like a couple of nights ago I got fucking baked because it helps me go to sleep. It helps me sleep. And I was just being like Mom. So yeah, so that's the sweetest thing I've ever heard so after. And then my grandfather, because he died. I still say, I love you, I still say, I love you, papa.

912
01:47:56.970 --> 01:48:02.940
Evan Martinez - Stax: what was that saying? Oh, so yeah. Yeah. And so, since since Sedona, and like talking to you, Koala.

913
01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:08.580
Evan Martinez - Stax: It like it does feel

914
01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:17.279
Evan Martinez - Stax: like it's nice to know that that is a spiritual practice like that. That's a spiritual act. And it was something that I just was doing before.

915
01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:30.520
Evan Martinez - Stax: You know, this was even a thing that I you know, before I even knew And now that, like I can. It's under the umbrella of spirituality. It feels nice. Yeah, like it feels good. It's it's cool. I think it's

916
01:48:30.730 --> 01:48:36.909
Evan Martinez - Stax: my dad has been trying to give me to be a more spiritual person for fucking 39 years.

917
01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.110
Evan Martinez - Stax:  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So to answer your question again, Joe.

918
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:55.279
Evan Martinez - Stax: I I think being just being more aware of what spirituality is, and and doing the things I was with intention. Yeah, it makes me by definition a more spiritual person.

919
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:58.080
Joseph Howlett: Second question.

920
01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:02.109
Joseph Howlett: and don't ask clarifying questions this time. You just got to

921
01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:04.340
Joseph Howlett: take it. are

922
01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:10.879
Joseph Howlett: the name of our show that we've agreed upon and might change is, I want to believe.

923
01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:13.140
Joseph Howlett: Do you want to believe

924
01:49:27.710 --> 01:49:31.499
Evan Martinez - Stax: I'm I'm trying to think about how to how to phrase my answer.

925
01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:37.419
Evan Martinez - Stax: The the shorter answer is, no, I'm not coming into this with an agenda.

926
01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:49.920
Evan Martinez - Stax:  I was talking about this with a friend in Flagstaff, you know, during the days I was in Sedona, after you guys had both left.

927
01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:55.080
Evan Martinez - Stax: And a lot of this stuff, you know, I keep saying the phrase like.

928
01:49:57.370 --> 01:50:02.979
Evan Martinez - Stax: whether or not, I believe, is not the question I'm at like. It's not important to me.

929
01:50:03.110 --> 01:50:08.619
Evan Martinez - Stax: and I keep saying the phrase like I I just don't know right, and I'm comfortable, not knowing

930
01:50:08.630 --> 01:50:12.430
Evan Martinez - Stax: and if something changes my mind, then great, it changes my mind.

931
01:50:12.450 --> 01:50:17.310
Evan Martinez - Stax: or if it pushes me, if it pushes the needle in one direction or the other great.

932
01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:25.669
Evan Martinez - Stax: But when my friend, the way she frames it is that like I think she says she, and she says I think that

933
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:30.939
Evan Martinez - Stax: all of this stuff are things we just don't yet understand.

934
01:50:31.210 --> 01:50:35.259
Evan Martinez - Stax: and in the future we will be able to.

935
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:46.329
Evan Martinez - Stax: And I like that better. And I and that feels more accurate to me then, just saying, I don't like I I I mean, I still don't know like they're both true.

936
01:50:46.490 --> 01:50:59.979
Joseph Howlett: but that feels more wise. That's like I want. I'm glad I have that recorded, because I mean this isn't, for I I think that's that. That answer is good. I don't want to. This isn't for the pod. But like

937
01:51:01.090 --> 01:51:04.870
Joseph Howlett: what your friends saying that like, that's the entire. That's the

938
01:51:05.670 --> 01:51:16.389
Joseph Howlett: to me. That's the most insidious version of the like positivist worldview like I'm I'm trying to dedicate my entire career to making people not believe the thing you just said.

939
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:29.629
Evan Martinez - Stax: What that we just don't, that you mean that I said, or that my friend said, these are things we just don't understand yet, and we will someday. well, to be clear, I didn't say that, my friend? Yeah, I mean, like.

940
01:51:29.770 --> 01:51:33.919
Thomas: what that means is eventually like someone

941
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:40.770
Thomas: with a Phd. Will write a paper about it, and it will fit within all of the things that

942
01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:48.980
Thomas: you know we've been studying in universities and laboratories and libraries, and like we can make this stuff fit in that box. I am like.

943
01:51:51.010 --> 01:52:03.860
Thomas: If we come to understand anything about this stuff in that way, I think it will be how our current view about everything that is not Wu is wrong.

944
01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:10.670
Thomas: The and how like these things already fit together, and they're separate.

945
01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:15.639
Thomas: and the attempt to bridge that gap between science and spiritualities bulls errant

946
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:19.409
Thomas: in a lot of ways depending on which part of it you're looking at.

947
01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:22.370
Thomas: I mean, I'll say, you know I don't know.

948
01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:33.930
Thomas: No, go ahead, Tom, go ahead. I'm curious what you think, but, I don't want to believe all of this stuff.

949
01:52:34.230 --> 01:52:38.349
Thomas: I want to find out whether there's something that I believe

950
01:52:38.670 --> 01:52:40.970
Thomas: and whether there is something worth believing in.

951
01:52:42.090 --> 01:52:45.610
Thomas: I'm okay if there's not. But I

952
01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:47.340
Thomas: spent

953
01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:51.670
Thomas: 99% of my life actively not looking.

954
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:56.840
Thomas: And now I want to know whether like was there something I missed?

955
01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:05.060
Thomas: You know it's not that I want to believe in spirituality. I think Joey really wants to feel this stuff. He wants this to be true. He already does believe it.

956
01:53:05.190 --> 01:53:08.430
Thomas: and he wants more. I'm somewhere in between

957
01:53:14.150 --> 01:53:15.630
Evan Martinez - Stax: anything else. Fellas.

958
01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:21.270
Thomas: Yeah, it was more than enough anything else you want to say about the don't even

959
01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:27.509
Evan Martinez - Stax: no, you guys got to come back just to hang out next time. I'd love to just have a few days, you know.

960
01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:31.180
Thomas: We're so that in the mic that was good. That's cute.

961
01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:46.469
Evan Martinez - Stax: Oh, yeah, I mean I I would love to just go back with you guys, but not work, and and just hang out for a few days, you know. Go, go to the swimming hole, go back to the creek, pick raspberries, go up the flag. I think it' be a lot of fun you think raspberries there.

962
01:53:46.770 --> 01:53:49.170
Evan Martinez - Stax: Yeah, razz. He's about eras. He's in black.

963
01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:53.530
Evan Martinez - Stax: I was going to say

964
01:53:54.360 --> 01:54:00.499
Thomas: I got myself. I I can't wait to go back. I would love to.

965
01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:11.620
Evan Martinez - Stax: I do dude, I do. I do want to check out that watering hole at that, Barista said. So I found out there's a really cool swimming hole out where exactly he talked about, which I think is

966
01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:15.220
Evan Martinez - Stax: what he was describing. There's an under there's a spring

967
01:54:15.250 --> 01:54:19.770
Thomas: that is in the earth that I think is underground.

968
01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:27.590
Evan Martinez - Stax: No, I don't know who knows the pitches I saw were underground, but it was just

969
01:54:27.970 --> 01:54:31.180
Evan Martinez - Stax: I don't know. I would be fun to check out, and it's certainly your fund to explore.

970
01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:35.910
Evan Martinez - Stax: I'm so glad we didn't check out that cave, we would have all been fucking dead.

971
01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:36.930
Evan Martinez - Stax: The question.

972
01:54:38.610 --> 01:54:40.630
Thomas: so why don't we stop recording?

973
01:54:40.770 --> 01:54:41.580
Joseph Howlett: Yeah.

974
01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:45.000
wow.

975
01:54:46.110 --> 01:54:48.300
Thomas: we booked.
