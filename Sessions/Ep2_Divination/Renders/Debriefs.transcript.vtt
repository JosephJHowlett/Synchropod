WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 I just turned it back on.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.320
 - So how do you guys feel about that?

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.820
 - I mean, like I don't know, obviously we'll never know

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.820
 whether Ashley is actually tapped into, you know,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.200
 what she says that she is, but whether or not

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.720
 that was, you know, real, whatever that means.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.080
 Like that was a really intense experience.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.040
 Like I kind of teared up a couple of times.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.040
 And it's interesting like just thinking about what that

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.120
 can do for you, like I don't think I would have been able

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.960
 to engage with, you know, these thoughts and like,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.840
 you know, emotions I've been having about my grandfather,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.000
 like because how else are you gonna do it, right?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.300
 Like it almost doesn't matter whether it's,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.160
 whether it was a real thing from an emotional perspective

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.760
 because it felt real.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.560
 - Yeah, it sounds like it's a real for you.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.760
 - Yeah.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.600
 - Joe?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.120
 - Well, she also plaids her mother's father.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.240
 - Yeah, it's fucking strange.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.160
 - It's really good.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.000
 Yeah.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 I mean, that's how, you know, I like Ashley, I trust her.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.160
 I don't think she was doing cold reading,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.560
 but that is how cold readings work, right?

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.400
 - Yeah.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.240
 - Sure.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.400
 I mean, that's the thing is like, I feel like in that moment,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 I could almost sense you guys asking, well,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.120
 what's the probability of this?

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.920
 Like, would she have found whatever the truth is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.480
 through whatever method she's using?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.040
 Like I was going, yeah, I was going through my head,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.760
 like, is this information Googleable?

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.600
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.440
 - Or you're really curious.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.240
 - Well, did you, you didn't tell her

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.960
 that we were talking about my grandfather?

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.640
 - No, I didn't tell her.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.840
 I just told her that you were hoping to connect with someone.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.880
 - And she doesn't know my last name, you know,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.560
 my last name isn't his last name.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.640
 - Yeah, and I will say that like, even that thing

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.600
 that we were all doing when she was doing that,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.640
 what are the odds of this?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.760
 How did she do this?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.800
 I think that's what we need to try to quiet

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.280
 as we go through this process, right?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.800
 Like, you allow yourself to be amazed by that

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.200
 because that's how you will experience greater meaning

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.800
 from what follows, right?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.400
 - Yeah, I guess that kind of resistance

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.040
 that questioning that like looking for the proof

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.040
 and the evidence is what removes you

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.040
 from being able to engage with that kind of stuff.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.880
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.320
 To the extent, the more you believe that that's,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.640
 that she is connecting with him,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.120
 the more it'll do for you.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.240
 - Evan, how did you feel about all that?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.840
 How did you feel about your reading?

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.800
 - Yeah, I mean, I felt so, I was resistant

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.640
 to some of the things she said.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.320
 I gotta flesh out the, like, really how I'm feeling sort of,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.640
 I think over the next couple of days,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.880
 but like the immediacy of it.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.080
 Yeah, I was resistant to some, it was hard to hear others.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.000
 And then some of it, I thought, was pretty spot on.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.840
 - Hmm.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.760
 It's so funny to me because like, I could hear you.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.120
 Not getting much out of it.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.480
 And, or this is my interpretation.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.720
 I felt like I could hear you not getting much out of it.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.200
 At the same time as I was feeling and hearing so much meaning

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.600
 and acuity in what she was saying

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.080
 for your life in particular.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.240
 - Yeah, I mean, it sounded like the kinds of things

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.200
 that I would tell you.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.720
 - Yeah, and then the reactions were so,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.480
 like it really sounded like it wasn't resonating.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.640
 - That's what I, but yeah, that's what I was thinking about

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.160
 exactly as explicitly was like it sounds,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.880
 some of it sounds like just advice from a good friend.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.960
 - Yeah.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.440
 - Which isn't a good thing or a bad thing.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.240
 It doesn't make me feel like she was valid or invalid.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.240
 It just, yeah, it was like something

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.680
 I was associating it with.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.600
 - But it's interesting, you know,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.840
 that the advice from a good friend that she gave you

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.560
 is very similar to the advice

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.840
 that we would give you knowing all of the specifics.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.160
 - Yeah, that isn't like general advice

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.200
 that would apply to anyone, what she said.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.920
 At least that's not how I view it.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.760
 - Sure, yeah.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.920
 - I mean, maybe it, like if we think back

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.080
 to what the questions were, like maybe it fits

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.480
 with the sort, like the frame of mind of what,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.840
 you know, she was saying, but maybe again, that's--

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.680
 - That's how it's doing, I guess.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.520
 - Needle of it.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.800
 - Yeah. (laughs)

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.640
 - Yeah.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.760
 - Which I get it, yeah.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.880
 - Cool, all right guys, I gotta dip out,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.600
 but that was a blast.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.760
 - Great, well, can I say what I felt about mine?

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.840
 - Oh shit, sorry.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.160
 - No, no, no, no, no, it was gonna ask me the mind.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.000
 Like we can move up.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.200
 - If you need to go, like Joey and I could just do that,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.280
 like we can cut it together with just you.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.120
 - Sorry guys.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.960
 - No, that's all right.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.800
 - But that was...

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.280
 - All right, this is a test.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.440
 Let's see how it sounds.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.280
 It sounds good.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.120
 So, Joey, what did you think about your reading?

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.720
 Is that what the right thing to call it, a reading?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.760
 - I think so, yeah.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.760
 So, yeah, I mean, I'm doing the thing again,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.520
 but to do the thing for a second,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.520
 I think I exuded already in the conversation

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.240
 in the Joey that she has heard in our two calls,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.960
 I think I already exuded the qualities

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.040
 that she recognized in her reading of me, right?

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.880
 - Right.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.360
 - But that said, like, I think it was really poignant.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.120
 I really like this idea that I'm going to this place

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.960
 to blossom, it'll be hard at first,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.160
 but then it'll be beautiful and I'll come away

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.760
 with some really meaningful new relationships,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.480
 maybe the relationship and leave.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.880
 I like all of those basic features.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.800
 - Yeah, I like you leaving the Bay Area too.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.640
 - Yeah.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.720
 - I just feel like home for Joey.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.400
 - Yeah, I know, I don't think it's a natural fit,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.160
 but it's also kind of what I need and like, I don't know.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.480
 Yeah, and she's, by the way,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.480
 like the way I posed my final question was like,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.440
 when people have asked me throughout my entire life,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.800
 when people have asked me what I want to do,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.160
 I've never had an answer, like it's always been bullshit

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.640
 when I do say something, and I feel like the last like two

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.720
 months is the first time that has not been true.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.240
 The first time I've had an answer that I like

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.320
 feeling my heart a little bit, and she said,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.560
 you're following your intuition, you should keep doing that,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.800
 and that is true for maybe the first time in my life,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.720
 which is nice.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.240
 - Yeah, I mean, I felt the same way with myself,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.440
 and also like, you know, from the questions that I asked,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.800
 I really wanted to be open and get into mental health stuff

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.840
 that I've been thinking about lately.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.680
 So I asked these questions that are really vulnerable

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.280
 and kind of speak to struggles that I've been having

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.120
 recently.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.480
 So she could have, you know, I think you could look

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.040
 at the questions that I asked until I go,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.640
 this is a guy who feels as though he's struggling,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.200
 so let's talk about struggling stuff.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.520
 I don't know, like, that doesn't really,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.360
 what it does is show that this isn't like definitive proof

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.480
 that what Ashley said she does is real, right?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.160
 But it isn't proof in the other direction,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.520
 it's not proof that it's not real, you can't prove it,

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.240
 and I guess that's, maybe that's the point?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.760
 - Yeah, so I was thinking this when you and Evan were talking

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.880
 that the reason I loved Ashley and this day,

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.880
 or this record, is that everything that happens

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.720
 fits perfectly in the one and the zero, right?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.480
 Like in the world where everything that happened

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.480
 was meaningful and specific to us and real and deep

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.800
 and prophetic, and in the reality where,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.320
 like, everything is statistical and cold reading

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.560
 and we were mirror, she's just mirroring our energy

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.440
 and all that, right?

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.960
 Like, I love that it, like, like everything

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.800
 we're going to encounter, it's not gonna fall cleanly

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.880
 in one or the other and it will be up to us

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.720
 to choose the one, you know?

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.960
 - Right, I mean, when you talk to people

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.920
 who have lived their lives believing in all of the stuff

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.720
 that falls into the category of things

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.360
 that we're investigating here, right?

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.320
 And you ask them, you know, how do you know?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.760
 It's real often the response you get is like,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.760
 well, I feel it, like what, like, like,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.720
 I know that I've felt this energy, right?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.720
 And that is completely disconnected

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:08.240
 from the questions we're asking about facts and reality, right?

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.440
 Like, if this is useful, if it's providing a service,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.160
 if you're getting something out of it,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.880
 that's really the only thing that matters

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.200
 and if you make meaning from that,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.760
 that's no better or worse than making meaning

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.600
 from something that we figured out from talking to,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.280
 you know, a psychiatrist with medical training

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.760
 or reading a study that was, you know,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.240
 performed under the highest standards of science, right?

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.920
 It's all just different ways of deciding what to believe.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.800
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.560
 Like, and like, like her brother, right?

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.280
 Like, she had this experience of seeing her brother

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.480
 and interacting with him and like,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.760
 there is no, did that happen or didn't that happen?

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.320
 It happened, she had that experience,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.080
 she described it to us, you know what I mean?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.880
 The only thing you can ask is if she's lying or not,

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.920
 and I think we all believe that the answer is

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.480
 definitely not, she is not a liar.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.480
 - Certainly didn't feel to me like she was being dishonest

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.320
 at any point.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.480
 - Yeah, so beyond that, like, there is no reality or not,

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.280
 that it is real, like that experience happened.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.600
 - The experiences are valid.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.600
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.080
 And like, I don't know, like today is perfect

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.680
 'cause it would have been like dumb, or it wouldn't have,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.160
 like it would have been almost less interesting

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.200
 if she, like the plaid thing and the train thing,

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.880
 if it was just like a billion details like that,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.240
 that it was like, oh shit!

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.040
 Like, that isn't, that would have been shittier

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.880
 than the day we got, you know?

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.720
 - Hmm.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.360
 I almost, I wanna talk to a skeptic,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.280
 like one of these people who debunks this stuff

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.200
 and ask them, you know, first of all,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.680
 it would be interesting to hear them go through this

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.920
 in line, by line, just decimate our experience

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.600
 and talk about why it's all dumb

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.800
 and we're just a bunch of sheep, you know,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.960
 we're marks that have had the wolf hole over our eyes,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.240
 there's two sheep men and boys, right?

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.960
 But then ask them, like, what does it matter

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.600
 if you're deriving meaning from it?

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.240
 Like, is there anything wrong with that

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.800
 if this is just getting in touch with, you know,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.440
 this, you know, deeper self and the things that you know

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.560
 when you're in tuition, right?

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.360
 If you're tapping into that, it doesn't really matter

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.640
 how you're doing it.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.480
 At least in this situation where Ashley, you know,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.480
 isn't ripping anyone off or, you know,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.000
 operating some kind of giant scam

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.800
 unless, you know, she's really playing the long con yet.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.160
 It could be years from now she'd be like,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.920
 well, I would love to do this again with you, but--

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.520
 - You'll have to pay me $5.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.280
 (both laughing)

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.600
 - Yeah.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.440
 - So where do we go from here?

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.160
 I guess I gotta unblock my chakras, right?

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.120
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.960
 - I think that's next.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.840
 Yeah, I didn't really get any,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.040
 oh no, I have to talk to God, that's some homework.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.000
 You talk to God, all Google chakras,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.360
 that's what she told me to do.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.680
 And I guess I gotta leave my apartment,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.640
 I gotta go outside.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.480
 - Yeah, I love that.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.320
 - That sounds like the hardest part.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.160
 - I love that she said like,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.800
 you don't have to like become an outdoorsy type.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.800
 I was like, I was like,

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.440
 is she about to tell Thomas he has to go climb out Marcy?

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.280
 Oh my God.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.040
 (both laughing)

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.560
 - I think that's it.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.560
 - Yeah, it's great.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.560
 - We can't be without Evan for longer anyway.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.400
 - Yeah.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.980
 (upbeat music)

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.560
 (upbeat music)

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.140
 (upbeat music)

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.720
 (upbeat music)

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.300
 (upbeat music)

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.980
 (upbeat music)

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.560
 (upbeat music)

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.240
 (upbeat music)

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.820
 (upbeat music)

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.400
 (upbeat music)

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.080
 (upbeat music)

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:56.700
 *silence*

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.880
 I mean for me it was kind of a big deal.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:08.780
 Like I was able, I think to work through some stuffs and like difficult feelings that I had about my grandfather, especially since he died,

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:14.180
 that I don't really know how else I would have been able to process, you know?

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.380
 Like the stuff that I got of it, I don't think I could have gotten out of therapy.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.680
 And I'm trying to turn the skeptical part of my brain off that wants to pick apart all the reasons why that wasn't real

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.880
 and I know we weren't really talking to my dead grandpa because it doesn't matter because I got something out of it.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:38.880
 And likewise, the sort of more general life advice she gave me, I mean actually doesn't know me, but the things that she said I think were really useful

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:47.680
 and it is the kind of stuff that I want to work on, you know, emotionally or whatever as I'm trying to become a better person.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.680
 So for me it was kind of a big deal.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.780
 And then Evan just talked, what are you saying?

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.380
 You can cut my shit over, right?

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.880
 I can just move your stuff over there.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.880
 Evan said how crazy it is that she nailed.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:04.880
 Well I said it gave her credibility and it validated herself a little bit by nailing home those three facts.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:12.380
 Yeah, I mean I'm sure if we talk to someone who debunk psychics, right, there's these people that that's like their whole job, presumably,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:24.080
 they could pick apart all the reasons why it's not amazing that she was able to, you know, guess or whatever it is, all these details about my relationship with my grandpa

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:37.280
 and the fact that I wanted to talk to him and like what, you know, color the jacket that he gave me was, but it really did help me lock in that she was saying all these things that were bizarrely coincidental.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.180
 And you found meaning out of those coincidences, right?

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.180
 That's right, yeah.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.180
 Yeah, I mean it was amazing, I don't know.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:51.180
 Maybe some expert would say it's not amazing, but I was pretty impressed.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:57.180
 Yeah, I mean I guess that it was vague enough that we could just be like, well that's how a cold reading works.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:06.180
 You say like very like, you know, broad things and you let the person know I might get some of this wrong and it's okay, like don't worry about it.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:13.180
 But it is what it is, as I was going through it, it felt real, it felt meaningful.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.180
 But like Mother's father is not that broad.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.180
 I gotta say, yeah sorry, Joe, go ahead.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.180
 No, just that.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:34.180
 I mean I was gonna go further and be like, the probability that she got, that it's your mother's father, plaid t-shirts and trains out of the entire English language, like what is the probability of that?

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.180
 That's gotta be like astronomically low, right?

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.180
 It is, except it was a plaid jacket, not a plaid t-shirt.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.180
 Does that matter?

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:50.180
 I don't think it matters because she said the vision was like fuzzy, like, you know, it's not like she can pinpoint like...

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.180
 She didn't say plaid t-shirt, does she?

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.180
 I think she said plaid.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:59.180
 No, I was saying like maybe you should say it again and say jacket, because we decided it was a jacket as we were doing it.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.180
 Oh, I just maybe...

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.180
 I don't think it matters.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.180
 I don't think it matters.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.180
 Yeah, but okay, so...

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.180
 It's interesting because it's like there's these two facets, right?

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.180
 There's the sense of meaning and then there's this sense of coincidence.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.180
 And the two are kind of unrelated, like the things you got out of it, it's...

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.180
 are kind of separate from...

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.180
 Like it's not like...

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.180
 The thing you've been...

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.180
 The thing you say...

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:29.180
 The thing you're saying you've been meaning to work through and this gave you a chance, it was not that he gave you a plaid jacket, right?

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.180
 Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.180
 The jacket's great.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:38.180
 So it's kind of like beside the point, but also it like sets you up emotionally for this sense of meaning, I guess.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.180
 Yeah, definitely.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:45.180
 And if I have it correctly, I think you wrote God's Voices Quiet on a whiteboard?

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.180
 Yeah, I did.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:52.180
 That is not the only thing I've been rotating Ashley saying on that whiteboard all week.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.180
 So yeah, for a while I had God's Voices Quiet.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:01.180
 And then I said you're better at listening than feeling, or I said listen, don't feel.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.180
 And I've kind of taken that and run with it because, well, okay, this is a whole other thing.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.180
 I want to hear Evan's...

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:19.180
 Yeah, Evan, I feel like Joey and I were able to turn off the no woo woo parts of our brains and engage with it, but it seemed like maybe you had a slightly harder time with that than we did.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.180
 Uh...

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.180
 I don't know.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.180
 Actually, I think I'm going to push back on that.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:35.180
 So I think just like zooming out in general, so I don't know if this has been clear up to this point or not, but I actually don't...

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.180
 My position on the woo is that I don't not believe in it.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.180
 My position is that I just don't know.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.180
 And so I'm like excited and open to explore.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.180
 I mean, you know, I think like...

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.180
 The fact, you know, yeah, I mean that's my position.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.180
 So it's not that I'm closed off to it, it's not that I have a problem being open to it.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:06.180
 I mean, sure, I think some things like if it were crystals, like depending on like what within the realm of woo woo that we're experimenting and exploring, I might be a little bit more skeptical than say others, but like...

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.180
 Again, I'm not like closed off from this stuff.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.180
 It's more than I'm just like...

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:16.180
 I take the position always usually of like, "Ah, I don't know, like there's no evidence. It's hard to prove."

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.180
 But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist, right?

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.180
 So it is.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.180
 And you know crystals are next, right?

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.180
 I mean, I'm looking forward to it. It sounds great.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:31.180
 I mean, yeah, I grew up in Sedona, Arizona. I was born in bread with crystals.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.180
 [laughter]

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:44.180
 So maybe the thing I fixated on with Evan, which I thought was your resistance to the reading, was actually a resistance to specifically what she was saying with regard to you.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:52.180
 Because like there was this moment where she asked you like, "Did any of this resonate?" And you kind of were like vaguely like, "Yeah, some of that sounds good."

00:17:52.180 --> 00:18:00.180
 And then we went to my reading and I started it by being like, "Well, wait, can we talk about Evan for a second? Because everything you said sounded so on point."

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.180
 And he seemed to not react to it.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.180
 Yeah, but it wasn't skepticism. Sorry, I cut you off, Joe.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:10.180
 No, so I guess maybe it's not skepticism about the act of reading, but maybe it's skepticism. Maybe it's like you...

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.180
 It was specific to what she was saying.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.180
 So how did you feel about the things that she told you the advice she gave me?

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:24.180
 Yeah, like I thought some of it was on and some of it was slightly off, you know? I think that's...

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.180
 What do you think was slightly off?

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.180
 Well, what do you think was slightly off?

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.180
 Nothing.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:40.180
 So, like, I heard her reading of the... I think it was the most impressive of the three for me, like the most on point of the three for me.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:49.180
 Like every statement she made felt resonant to me, and I could see you not deriving much meaning from it.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:55.180
 Yeah, almost everything that she said was very close to advice that I would give you.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:01.180
 Like, I wouldn't have come up with you need to develop a spiritual practice, but pretty much everything else I think is stuff that I have said to you in the past.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:06.180
 I would say that you need to develop a spiritual practice if I didn't think that it was pointless to say.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.180
 Like, that's in my heart, but I would never say it to you.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:14.180
 Sure, yeah. What were some of the three, I guess...

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.180
 I'm curious what you guys think were the three sort of most spot-on things that she said about me?

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:28.180
 Well, she was talking about your job search, and she said maybe you need to expand where you're looking and start trying different things,

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:34.180
 which I think is really good advice. Like, you've been mostly applying to startups and tech jobs, right?

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.180
 And maybe there's another way forward if that hasn't been working.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:42.180
 Yeah, it has kind of been a one-track search, and she was saying, like, look in a different direction, which is pretty smart.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:50.180
 Right, sure. And then she was... And then you were talking about... And then you asked when will I find a partner,

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:58.180
 and her advice was essentially you need to work on yourself first, and that stuff comes after you develop a better relationship with yourself.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:10.180
 And even though you are pretty secure in your own person, I think there is some opening up and softening that you could do, you know, emotionally and psychologically.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:15.180
 And that's the really hard one. So first, I want to say the easier one, which is...

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:25.180
 She said that the next person you find, she had this funny yoga thing, right? So she said the next person you find, first of all, is going to come sooner than all of this work is done.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:33.180
 I think that's so true. And like, I think you're not going to go through the full breakup arc before the next one, the real one comes.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:41.180
 And then she also said that this person will be someone who has done all of that interior work, which is really, really different than the person you just broke up with.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:52.180
 It'll be someone who's in touch with their own innermost feeling, somebody who hangs out at a yoga studio. I don't know, that sounds super resonant to me.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:21:05.180
 So, yeah, I guess the reason why, you know, maybe what came across as me not really connecting with what she was saying is, so for the job search, the "when will I be ready for a relationship?"

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:14.180
 And then, "Who will my next partner likely be?" Or what kind of person they'll be? It's all again, it's just like, yeah, I mean, it sounds great, but at the end of the day, I don't know.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:27.180
 I mean, none of us actually know, right? Like, you know, if you were to ask me, like, if I were to ask you guys that same question about, you know, "When will I be ready to find another partner?"

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:45.180
 Yeah, you might give me the exact same advice, and it's true, but again, it's not like, I don't know if, like, so what separates one of you from, like, my point is, is like, what is the difference when that information comes from one of my close friends, like one of you guys, or whether it comes from a median/psychic?

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:56.180
 Like, what is, like, the component that this person is adding that, like, makes it special, right? Because again, like you both said, either one of you could have given me this exact same information, you know?

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:11.180
 Well, I guess for me what separates it is the fact that Ashley gave you the same advice that I would give you feels like magic, right? Like, how did she know to give you the same advice that I would give you as someone who's been your friend for years now?

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:18.180
 And whether or not that's meaningful to you is a really personal thing, and I don't think that should give--

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.180
 Not that, again, but like, we prompted her with these questions, right?

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:26.180
 So she knew that I had just recently gotten into a-- that I'm dealing with a breakup, because we told her that.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:38.180
 She knows that I'm looking for a new job because I told her that, and so it's, you know, it's not that much of a stretch, really at all, for somebody to be like, yeah, like, you probably are feeling a little shut down, you're feeling a little hurt right now.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:44.180
 You know, the next person is gonna come when, like, you're opening up back, you're opening back up a little bit more, you're ready to accept love, et cetera, et cetera.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:54.180
 It's like that just, to me, is like a logical next step, but maybe you're right, like, I don't know, maybe I-- maybe it is something more anomalistic that this person who's a complete stranger gave me this similar advice.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:23:04.180
 So is there anything that she said that you have carried with you throughout the last week or so that did feel meaningful or after useful?

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:13.180
 Yeah, the job search stuff. I mean, not that I feel like what she told me was very ground breaking, but, you know, it is interesting.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:28.180
 Certainly that she mentioned that I should broaden, sort of, the scope within which I'm applying, you know, and I've really tried to take that to hearts and, you know, now jobs that I look for online that I think I might be right for.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:41.180
 I'm also looking that they're sort of outside of what I've normally been applying to and, like, the startup world, like that kind of community, like I'm applying now to larger companies and et cetera, et cetera.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:48.180
 So yeah, that's something that I've certainly taken with me and have focused on since we talked with Ashley.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:58.180
 So I guess my question then is for you, was the Ashley experience a failed experiment or did it work for you?

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:10.180
 I don't know if I'm looking at it in a failure or a non-failure, sort of. That's not something that I'm really concerned about.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:17.180
 Certainly it's not a failure, right? I mean, I can easily say that. But it's not like I haven't thought about it in terms of success or failure.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:27.180
 It was just more of like a really interesting experience, right? I'm like, essentially, just getting a lot more information about this new world that I've never really experienced before in my life.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:34.180
 And then at the end of this entire project, right, I'll take all these data points and I'll just see how I feel.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:40.180
 And at that point, maybe I'll have shifted one way or the other. Maybe I won't. But it's not like success or failure.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.180
 I think what's important for me anyways is to look at the entire arc and see where I stand at the end of it.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:54.180
 So I want to go back if that's okay. Like a few minutes ago, you were talking, Evan, about how her advice is not much of a stretch given the information that you've given her.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:25:03.180
 It's not that crazy that she would be that on point. Correct. So I misspoke earlier when I said I was wrong about your skepticism.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:08.180
 That is skepticism about the process. That is not skepticism about her particular advice.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:17.180
 You're saying the things she said to you, which were on point, were not impressive because she was cold reading or something like that.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:27.180
 But again, I'm not like, I'm still open to the idea, but I'm not that easily impressed. That's all I'm saying, right?

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:42.180
 I don't know if, you know, I don't know if skepticism is the right word to describe that. It's more of just like, sure, yeah, she said some interesting things, but like very easily this could be, you know, this other thing.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:53.180
 It doesn't mean that I believe it is her just doing like a cold reading. It just means like, yeah, it's possible, right? But it also goes along with that is, is, is, yeah, me just not being so like easily impressed with people.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:26:05.180
 So I saw a lot. Can I give one note to everyone, including myself? I'm just looking at the sound waves here. The more breaks between sentences, the more likely I'll be able to include people's thoughts.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:15.180
 Because if it's super long, I'm going to have to cut the whole thing because if it's like 40 seconds, then it's just me like just consecutive talking.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:24.180
 Yeah, if it's a good, like, if you like, just like, I think if we all take more breaths and even when I was looking back at my own shit, it's the same problem.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:28.180
 So like, yeah, more more breaths in between thoughts.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:36.180
 So, so what's interesting to me there, Evan, is that I saw...

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.180
 That was disgusting, sorry, fucking Christ.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:52.180
 So what's interesting to me, Evan, is that I saw a lot of poignancy in your reading. I felt your defenses up at that time and I feel like that's being...

00:26:52.180 --> 00:27:01.180
 I feel like that's being validated now.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:08.180
 Sorry, I'm not done. I saw your defenses up at that time and I feel like that's being validated now.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:28.180
 And it's clear that I think what you should ask yourself, what I would like you to ask yourself, is this resistance, this skepticism that you can't let go of, preventing you from seeing the meaning in your reading that I saw in your reading.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:44.180
 I guess my question to you, then both of you maybe is. So, you both seem to not, or at least you, Joe, Joe seem to not have any skepticism going into this experience with Ashley.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:52.180
 So does that mean you believe her that she is a psychic and that she is a medium 100%?

00:27:52.180 --> 00:28:07.180
 Because if the answer is no, then we're not different. I think you can put any kind of label on it that you want. And to me, like defenses and skepticism, there is a negative connotation in my mind about those in the context of what we're trying to do here.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:27.180
 And the reality is like I said, it's not that I'm skeptic in my mind or I'm defensive, it's just that like, I don't know, and it's rational thinking in my mind that it's rational thinking to me to just be like, oh yeah, there are other ways that this information could be coming up.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.180
 But it doesn't mean that's what it is, it just means that it's possible.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:43.180
 Well, I think the interesting thing is based on what I've heard from you guys, I think going into this, I might be the most skeptical, most stuck in enlightenment thinking of the three of us.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:29:00.180
 And I, over the last week, have been thinking a lot about what Ashley said and the parts of myself that are totally skeptical that don't believe that she's a psychic, when I allow that to enter my thinking, the feeling of meaning and usefulness that I got out of what she said starts to follow.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:17.180
 And I've been trying to push that out a little bit and just embrace this idea and swim in this, it's not even uncertainty, but in this space where I'm allowing it to be real and meaningful, because otherwise, it doesn't matter.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:33.180
 Yeah, when you frame the problem in terms of how skeptical or un-skeptical you are, you're already bringing skepticism into it, right? Like, it's not that I'm not a skeptic, it's that I was not asking the question, is this real or is this not real?

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:42.180
 Right? If you ask that question, you're already doing the thing. You're already saying how outrageous is it that she would guess this, or is it totally reasonable that she would guess this?

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:53.180
 Given the questions we ask, you're already doing that rationalizing, that equation of that enlightenment thing. The meaning I get is from not asking.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:30:04.180
 Just a little meta-analysis, for our show, it seems like we're going in this direction anyway, but if you're a skeptical guy, this is all bullshit.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:29.180
 That's kind of useful narratively that one of us is like, "Come on, but I don't want you to put that on." It's even better than that, because I'm saying it as a mic for no reason, because there's this weird two-level thing going on right now, which is that Evan, it's true, Evan used to do all this crazy woo-woo shit, he's not opposed to it in principle, and you are in principle, but not in practice.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:37.180
 But Evan had trouble engaging with it on the same level in practice. I think there's this extra thing happening.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:50.180
 I don't know if that's true. I don't know if I had issues engaging with it in practice. I'm curious.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:59.180
 It's not about, at least for me, I wasn't thinking in the moment, is Ashley real or is she not?

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:13.180
 To me, I was trying to keep in my mind, "Am I, are we getting meaning out of this or aren't we?" I think that, for me, was the most important part of this experience.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:24.180
 Just because what she said may not have resonated with me as much as it resonated with you guys, it doesn't mean that I didn't get some meaning out of it.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:28.180
 I'm trying to just gauge it by those metrics rather than the former.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:35.180
 Yeah, I hear you. You disagree that your skepticism prevented you?

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:39.180
 You disagree that you had your defenses up during that reading?

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:47.180
 No, I'm not saying that. Maybe they were up to some degree. I think the real answer to that is all of our defenses were up to some varying degree.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:58.180
 Maybe mine were up more than yours and I just wasn't aware of it. I just wasn't trying to focus on that. I wasn't focusing on the questions that might have made those defenses even stronger.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:05.180
 Can you imagine going to a psychic again for help or advice in your life in the future?

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:12.180
 This isn't the first psychic that I've been to. Please tell us more. Come on.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.180
 What?

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:18.180
 Yeah, this isn't the first psychic that I've seen.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:22.180
 What other times have you been to a psychic and why?

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:28.180
 I went to a psychic in Sedona and I went to a psychic in Los Angeles one time.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.180
 Did you think that they were real?

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.180
 Again, I went in being like, I don't know.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.180
 When you left, what did you think?

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:44.180
 That's a good question. It's been too many years for me to really recall what I was feeling after I left.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:50.180
 I went in for very specific reasons and I was looking for very specific answers.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:33:00.180
 I was using the psychic and I was seeing the psychic for a very different purpose than what we're seeing Ashley for in this project.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:06.180
 Fuck, I forgot what I was going to say because I was making like calming me because of how good that was.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:10.180
 He was a different person than he was going into it.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.180
 So did you get out of it?

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.180
 You're going to ask me what I asked them?

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:20.180
 I was going to say, did you get what you wanted out of it when you went those times?

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:30.180
 Again, it was so long ago that it's hard for me to recall exactly what I asked, but I do remember feeling satisfied with the experience that I had with them.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:37.180
 I don't think I was jumping for joy, but if nothing else, you can get a different perspective.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:51.180
 Whether or not one of the psychics greatest power is to just get you to think about your life in a different way than what you were previously thinking about it before you went in there.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:58.180
 I certainly remember leaving there being like, I'm thinking about this issue and I'm thinking about this question that I can mean you within a different way.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:04.180
 So it sounds like long story short, you might recommend psychics to people.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:08.180
 I think after the experience that I had, I kind of agree.

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:11.180
 Yeah, I'm 100% yes, on psychics.

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:22.180
 But I can get on board with that, but I think it's important to explain our perspective in using psychics.

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:27.180
 And as long as they're not ripping you off, a lot of these people are charlatans.

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.180
 Well, actually excluded.

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.180
 I can't not dig into that.

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.180
 I mean, I think even- Sorry, Madam.

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.180
 No, just say more, Evan.

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.180
 We can include.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:39.180
 There's no way we can include a lot more than we'll be able to have.

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:42.180
 I know, but like all of this is going to be cut, right?

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.180
 I don't know how to have a conversation.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.180
 Well, we can keep going.

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:47.180
 I don't know.

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:48.180
 We might get the best part.

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.180
 Sure.

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.180
 Well, I mean, you want to- Yeah, go ahead.

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.180
 No, we can just- We can talk about it more later.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:55.180
 I don't know how to not talk about it.

00:34:55.180 --> 00:35:01.180
 Do we- I think- Like, what did you want to get on tape out of this?

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.180
 Do we get it?

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.180
 Yeah, pretty much.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.180
 Okay, let's stop.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:09.180
 I think we shouldn't dig into it more, actually, because we're going to go and start going in circles.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.180
 We already did a little bit.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:16.180
 I don't think we should be doing it.

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:23.180
 We're going to go ahead and start going in circles.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:28.180
 We're going to go ahead and start going in circles.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:33.180
 We're going to go ahead and start going in circles.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:38.180
 We're going to go ahead and start going in circles.
