WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 So when I see a spirit, it's like person, but in static.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.760
 I got images of like someone in the woods and like plaid, like a red

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.800
 plaid, trains and cars if you liked.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.480
 And so this is where you're going to have to tell me if I'm off or if I'm on.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 So if I'm off, I will move on.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.400
 If I'm on, I will keep going.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.720
 If you're doing a cold reading, you're doing a really good job.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.760
 We're talking to this medium.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.720
 And how do you guys feel about it?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.920
 I've gotten much more nervous than it was a couple of days ago.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.320
 You know, I like, I can't help.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.760
 I can't shake this feeling like, oh, she's just going to do a cold reading.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.800
 It's just like a technique that she like knows how to like cast the net wide enough

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.920
 to be vague enough that it could be right.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.200
 And like, yeah, the cold reading thing has been bugging me too, because if it

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.600
 feels like we're being manipulated.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.400
 Well, if it feels like there's like a program being played out on us, you know,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.720
 I went through a real magician's phase in my life before.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.240
 I don't know if you guys know this.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.800
 Of course he does.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.040
 And does that mean like dating magicians?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.680
 Just all kinds of things, magicians and illusions.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.640
 I like I tried to be one for a moment.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.640
 You're you're you're interested in illusions.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.480
 Yeah. And so there's, you know, and and there are, I mean, there are real, like,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.400
 I mean, identical techniques so like that psychics and mediums use that like

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.600
 mentalists in the magician community also employ when they're like talking to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.840
 like a crowd of people.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.200
 Can I can I can I push back on like, please?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.120
 Yeah, please push.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.360
 Those things you're saying what you mean to say is that those things are proven

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.240
 to be things that some people who call themselves psychics do, right?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.440
 Like we don't those those books you read don't say anything about Ashley

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.640
 who we're talking to on Sunday.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.040
 No, no, absolutely not.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.520
 Um, since since we have a few minutes, I'm curious.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.200
 Have you guys thought at all about your questions?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.960
 Yes. Having a lot of trouble with it.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.360
 Mm.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.440
 Well, I think I think you want to ask the kind of question that

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.800
 is for me, I'm asking like the kind of question I would ask my therapist

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.200
 or at least the kind of stuff that I want to work on in therapy, Evan.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.880
 Sorry.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.920
 If you don't let me know before you cough next time,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.240
 we're going to have a recording of me whipping your throat out.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.840
 I'm sorry. You know, I'll be getting over.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.520
 What just let me know.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.480
 I'm sorry.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.520
 I have a bunch of Flem in my throat.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.960
 Um, can we pause for a second?

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.160
 What's the difference between a psychic and a medium?

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.000
 Well, she said the psychic portion and the medium portion.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.960
 So I think psychic is like telling the future and medium is speaking to the dead.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.720
 Gotcha.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.680
 And the the dead person that we've decided to speak to, we're going to talk to my

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.640
 grandpa who died earlier this year and who I had kind of a fraught relationship

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.840
 with. I guess we can talk to the medium about how that relationship was fraught,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.440
 but I'm going to try and speak the way that I would speak to him through her.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.000
 Yeah.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.200
 Did she tell you to like come up with any questions or anything?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.720
 Well, I don't think that she's said anything about the like preparing,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.000
 but I don't think I need to.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.400
 I think.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.640
 So just I think I think I could talk to him communicating with him.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.160
 Yeah.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.600
 Yeah.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.040
 Okay.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.640
 Okay.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.080
 Gotcha.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.160
 But I'm going to try and engage with it and take it really seriously.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.120
 And I, you know, like if I think if I act like it's really serious,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.000
 then I think I could get something out of it, you know, whether it's,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.840
 yeah, and whether or not it's real is kind of a wrong question.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.640
 Well, what she, what she asked us to do tonight, if each of you could say a

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.600
 prayer to whomever you feel comfortable praying to and ask that I be able to get

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.200
 any messages that you all need and that you give me permission to read.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.120
 Evan, do you, do you feel comfortable praying to anything or anyone?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.840
 Yeah.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.680
 I mean, not really.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.000
 I don't really pray.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.920
 If if you were like on an airplane and it was like about to crash, do you think you

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.920
 would pray?

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.680
 My instinct says no.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.480
 You would just be like, fuck this sucks.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.920
 Uh, yeah, probably.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.000
 Well, what about like, please God, let me not die right now.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.640
 I don't even think I would say something like that.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.880
 I don't think I would either.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.400
 Joy, I guess you would.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.880
 Well, I'm a little bitch.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.200
 I'm like, that's not, that's not a, that's not like a deep or, or meaningful or,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.280
 I think an important type of prayer.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.280
 Like I, I think that's the kind of prayer that's kind of bullshit and not

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.880
 worth anything.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.000
 Well, but, but yeah, I would do that shit because I'd be terrified.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.200
 I don't.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.920
 And let me restate the best version of myself who I am not would like feel

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.320
 a sense of gratitude to something.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.360
 So like it wouldn't be like, I think I would feel a sense of gratitude.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.760
 That is religious in nature.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.760
 Hmm.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.800
 Um, anyway, so yeah, what do you guys want to do for the prayers?

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.640
 Do you want to say them?

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.800
 Like I'll say, I'll say a prayer right now.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.640
 And that sounds great.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:06.200
 So I sincerely ask of the universe to give us something that feels salient on Sunday

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.880
 because we're here in this search for, we're here trying to engage.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.040
 With this other thing, and this is our first attempt.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.640
 So I could use a little bit of like a training wheels, you know, give us something

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.120
 right over the plate, you know, uh,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.000
 I like that.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.440
 Nice, nice, nice, man.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.280
 I like that too.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.240
 Well, this sounds good.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.840
 Let's go.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.360
 Every night I'll go say our prayers and we'll talk about them on Sunday

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.240
 before we talk to the medium.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.680
 Just never thought I'd hear you say that.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.520
 Yes.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:43.160
 Ashley, how are you?

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.720
 I'm good.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.000
 Try not to be nervous.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.560
 I'm also nervous.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.200
 Yeah, we're all a bit.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.680
 We're all feeling a little bit nervous.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.080
 We're all nervous.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.680
 Yeah.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.400
 Exactly.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.720
 Yeah.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.920
 So first off, like I don't have a clarity of what it is that you do.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.640
 Could you like, is there we can, you can explain it to us?

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.880
 I sit.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.640
 Well, the simple way is I do psychic medium readings where I tune in.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.200
 To your energy and try to get that snapshot of your future.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.320
 And then I can connect with people on the other side.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.520
 If that's what people want.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.880
 Wait, so like, have you always done this or do you have a job job

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.400
 that you go to every day, like a nine to five?

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.480
 So my day job is I investigate scams and financial exploitation for a living.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:40.400
 And so, you know, that's very follow the evidence and the proof and look at everything logically.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.680
 And it's very, very different in process.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.600
 And the fact that a lot of times mediums will get or psychimidians will be

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.720
 labeled as a scam.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.280
 I don't tell people because it's so taboo.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.400
 It's just taboo.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.200
 How do you feel your life is enriched now with respect to those periods

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.560
 when you are closed off from it?

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.720
 Like, what have you, what have you gained by opening yourself to it?

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.680
 Yeah, like a whole different life altering perspective that helps calm

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.160
 my fear of death, that helps calm my fear of my loved ones dying.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.640
 And when you tap into that need that that other person has and connect to that

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.760
 and help them with that need, I don't know how to describe that.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.240
 Like saying that it's profound for both for both of us.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.040
 And so it's like I get to experience how loved someone else is.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.880
 Yeah, so I think we should get into that.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.760
 Why don't you talk about like what you told me, like, like your beginnings

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.320
 and why this is a natural step for you.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.440
 And then also how your relationship with your abilities have like evolved over time.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.080
 Sure.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.320
 So I grew up a Mormon.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.000
 I probably had my first experience when I was.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.560
 There's probably five, but I was so young, I didn't know what I was seeing.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.160
 Like when I see a spirit, it's like an outline of a person, but in static.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.920
 But I didn't realize what I was seeing.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:14.800
 And then the next time that I remember was when I was eight, I was in my backyard.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.080
 And for this brief second, I just saw this image of a person.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.560
 And I knew it was my grandpa.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.320
 And I did you know what was going on?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.480
 Like, did you like were you able to sort of like where were you mentally, emotionally

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.840
 during these sort of first occurrences?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.520
 So it still didn't occur to me that not everybody saw this stuff.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.120
 Because I grew up in the community and the culture and the religion that there are angels

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.960
 and there are demons and there are entities of light and good.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.400
 And everybody has a spirit and sometimes you see them and there's this all of these

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.520
 stories throughout our church history of people seeing things.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.360
 So it's like this is just where everybody sees things.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.120
 Yeah, I guess I, yeah.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:06.280
 What so how do you refer to this, this kind of empathy that you do?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.360
 Like is it mediumship?

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.440
 Like what do you call it?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:16.720
 It's like an extreme ability to empathize whether people want me to or not.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.720
 There's permission involved.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.000
 Joey mentioned something about your family and we were wondering if you would be

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 comfortable talking about that and sort of what you learned from that experience.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.720
 And I guess what happened?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.760
 Sure.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.480
 My brother and I were very close.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.040
 He committed suicide five years ago.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:45.200
 Um, so anyway, my, my brother appeared as this mass in my bedroom, like, and back to

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.080
 the, the static, the, just like the static outline of a person.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.440
 And the energy that I was feeling from him was so intense, like guilt.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.840
 And I, it was like I knew that death didn't bring him what he thought it would.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.880
 Um, feeling and knowing that death didn't accomplish what he thought he would.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.640
 And he was like just rocked with regret.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.440
 And so the only thing I knew to do was say, like, we're going to be okay.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.560
 Let you can move forward.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.320
 Did you feel, I mean, like that, that's such an awful, like it's like the worst

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.560
 feeling you could have after losing a loved one to also have this feeling that like

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.240
 they're not even that piece.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.000
 I mean, so I'm wondering like when you, when you said what you said to him, did you

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.920
 feel like there was some connection there?

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.160
 Like it made contact.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.120
 Well, that one thing taught me one thing that you are the same here as you are

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.880
 on the other side.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.360
 You don't magically change.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.640
 You are the same.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.560
 So it's not going to accomplish what you think it will.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.440
 Um, you're either going to have to fix it now with your body or you're going to

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.880
 have to fix it on the other side.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.600
 You can pick which one, but it's probably easier here than to fix it on the other

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:57.880
 side.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.120
 So I'm still going to need therapy after I die.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.960
 Yeah.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.280
 Exactly.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.960
 Exactly.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.200
 So you can get therapy now or you can get therapy there.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.120
 Um, also, what's a copay look like?

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.320
 I might have better insurance.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:16.840
 Yeah.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:22.640
 So you see your brother, you see my brother and, and that was very sad.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.800
 Um, and anyway, then like, oh, there was two weeks between when he died and when he

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.360
 had the, when we had the funeral for him.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:36.440
 And a few days before the funeral, I have this very intense and real dream where he

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.240
 comes to me and like I'm sitting with my husband in a restaurant who walks in and

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.680
 he's like, okay, at that point.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.000
 I'm so sorry.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:45.800
 God damn.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:52.200
 I mean, I'm glad that he's okay, but like fuck, you know, um, one last thing before we

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.920
 start, can you tell us like what you're going to do, like physically or mentally?

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.920
 Like what do you do to prepare or like maintain this, like state of openness?

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:11.760
 I, I usually will do some stretches and, um, shocker work and ask that, um, um, that

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:20.640
 I may be able to know, think channel, uh, to the best of my ability, uh, to help you

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.120
 the most.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.560
 Huh.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.320
 So how do we start?

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.240
 All right.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.560
 So I've got an M.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.200
 Um, okay.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.800
 So I'll just jump right into my questions.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:38.760
 Uh, question one is, am I overextending myself and like, should I drop something to

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.240
 free up mental and emotional energy?

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:49.920
 Uh, question two is how much time must pass before I'm ready for another relationship.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:56.560
 And question three is, so I keep getting to the final round of job interviews and

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.000
 feeling like I have it only to be rejected.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 And so like, is there something that I can do to, to like, make this happen and like

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.080
 seal the deal, you know?

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.520
 Okay.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.800
 And so I'm just going to take a minute.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.560
 The, I'm just going to take a minute.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.040
 So you'll just hear some silence.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.120
 Feel free to edit it out because this is not like the TV where people just instantly

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:22.680
 get stuff.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.960
 It's just going to take me a minute.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:30.200
 I'm going to zone in and I, I will probably have some, some follow up questions.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.680
 Cause sometimes I'll get some words and I'll need some clarification why I'm getting that word.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.480
 So.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:50.480
 I see your activities.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.680
 I feel like you haven't tapped into the depth of your soul and your intuition.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:01.920
 Like you are doing all of these things that are superficial, superficially,

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.800
 purpose and superficial doesn't mean bad.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.600
 It's like busy work.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:12.800
 Like you can keep yourself busy and you can do these things that will, you know, take up your time.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.000
 But when you, when it comes to your depth and actual development, that there's some digging

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.160
 that needs to be done there.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.480
 And some, it feels like you're, I mean, the, the openness, the general direction that you're

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.320
 going is good.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:33.840
 It feels like there's a window that is opening to add lower depth.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:40.400
 This lower depth is kind of like the spiritual side that will help you with your intuition,

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.040
 which is going to help you with everything else.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.000
 But your next relationship is after you've built some depth.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.280
 Like you need to get some type of a spiritual practice.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.520
 I'm not even going to tell you what spiritual practice you find something that works for you

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.480
 that helps you connect.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.200
 Does any of that resonate at all?

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.280
 And you can tell me now if it doesn't.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:05.800
 Uh, yeah, I mean, I definitely don't have like a spiritual practice.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.280
 So you're, you're, you spot on.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.960
 Um, but yeah, yeah, I mean, it does.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.520
 Yeah, for sure.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.240
 I have a question if it's okay.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:13.560
 Yeah.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.760
 Um, Evan is really tough because he's a very communicative person.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.400
 Like he, he's better at navigating like social dynamics than anybody I know, including

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.240
 like being a really good friend and being expressive as a friend.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.240
 But, but I do feel like there is that like the moment he has a, if something I say,

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.560
 it makes him feel some type of way, he will tell me like directly.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.760
 Um, but then I do kind of feel like there might be some kind of impenetrability

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.920
 behind this behind this, like you're very good at navigating the sea of emotions.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.080
 But then like the depths, I feel like I never get to touch.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.120
 I guess my question is like, what does that look like?

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.000
 What would that, what would that look like to you?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.840
 I don't know.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.960
 Like it's just a feeling.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.000
 And then, and then I, I mean, and I feel like we've gotten at this before you and me.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.520
 Um, and again, like I don't, it's not like you're doing anything wrong.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.920
 I mean, I, I do feel really connected with you.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.640
 It's just like I feel like there's some level that I can't get to.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.160
 I don't know.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:19.080
 It feels like the first person in the room to cry would not be Evan.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.840
 I think that's probably true.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:27.040
 And then the other thing is I would say that like this relationship that just ended.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.160
 I think the next person will be somebody who has figured out that kind of depth of

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.880
 soul stuff.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.720
 Like I think that might maybe exactly what you need.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.560
 Somebody who's coming at you, having worked out themselves beforehand, you know?

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.440
 Yeah, that, that kind of groundedness and self understanding that you were talking

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.360
 about, I think your ex boyfriend didn't have any of that stuff figured out.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.880
 From my perspective, I think that was one of the problems in that dynamic is that.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.680
 Yeah, they felt like they just came with a bit of chaos.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.160
 This next person doesn't have that same chaos and they haven't figured out.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.640
 So yeah.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.800
 Yeah.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.320
 All right.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.280
 Any questions or anything, not make sense?

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:12.920
 Um, no, I mean, it's there's like like internal resistance to some of the things

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.440
 that you said.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.000
 And then like that was my immediate gut reaction to a few of them.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.120
 And then after that, I was like, well, let me, let me just think about like sort of

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.160
 what you're talking about.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.360
 And then after after I did that, I was like, no, there's something, you know,

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.520
 I mean, there's some truth, I think to what you're saying.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.040
 Okay.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.040
 Good.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.880
 Um, it feels like everything will come together when you get in touch with your gut,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.200
 like truly, deeply in touch with your gut and your intuition.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.080
 Okay.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.400
 Okay.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:42.880
 Great.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.360
 Thank you.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.480
 Yeah.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.800
 Who's next?

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.720
 We've got Joe.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.200
 Yeah.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:53.040
 So I, as like we talked about, I engage with this stuff a little bit.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.200
 I have this Christian background.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.560
 I go to Quaker meetings and I, I, uh, I don't know, like I, I try to listen,

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.920
 speak and listen, right?

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.720
 To this Quakers call it the inner light to the God inside of me and everyone.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.000
 Right.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.160
 I mean, it's not that I doubt the reality of the thing.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.240
 It's just that I, I try to do this.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:16.680
 And I, I feel like I get close, but not quite there, you know, and, and I feel

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.000
 in more in the mornings and I have a lot of trouble, particularly at night,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.240
 uh, getting with that, like truth that feels comforting.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.800
 So then I don't feel comforted and I'm wondering any, anything you do.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.920
 Uh, yeah, there's, there's, one important thing to know is that I don't

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:42.520
 continually always have this very sustained, like feeling of connection.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.720
 There have been very significant moments in my life where I haven't felt any

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.160
 connection.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:46.920
 Yeah.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.400
 Um,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:59.240
 I'm feeling like you need to quiet your mind and part of the reason that you

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:04.720
 haven't had like the warm fuzzy is mainly because of your brain.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.600
 Like you need to quiet your body, your mind and everything.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:15.320
 Just stop and understand that God's voice is quiet.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:22.480
 And that sometimes you won't feel because feeling might not be your

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.440
 strength, hearing may be your strength.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:31.120
 Um, and so when you quiet your body and you quiet your mind, listen to the

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.280
 words that come to your mind.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.040
 We expect these like big roaring, like booming God voice.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.880
 And that's not how it is.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.200
 It feels like thoughts, part of the reason that mediumship was so hard when I

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.560
 started learning is because it's hard to discern between my own thoughts and the

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.400
 thoughts of spirit.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.240
 Yeah, very, very similar.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:55.120
 Um, and the same with intuition, like, how do I know I'm not just anxious?

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:00.280
 And how do I know if, you know, this is, you know, like a warning or how do I

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.000
 decipher and determine the only way you can do that is with practice.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.160
 And so it just feels like you need to listen that your strength is in hearing.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.080
 Not in feeling.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:12.840
 Great.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.520
 Yeah.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.600
 That's really helpful.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.080
 Thank you.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:15.920
 Okay.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.360
 Tom.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.640
 Hello.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:27.200
 So, um, normally when I, when I pick up on someone on the other side, um, I

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.240
 will get like the clear feeling on the left or the right.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:38.400
 And it, it feels kind of like both, which is weird.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.600
 Um, male on the mother's side.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.520
 Yeah.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:45.880
 Yeah.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.440
 Uh, you, you asked, uh, you asked me to pick someone out that we were going to

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.040
 try and channel it was, it was my mom's father who died, uh, earlier this year.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.280
 Good.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:56.720
 Yay.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.080
 Okay.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.520
 So I'm.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.000
 It's pretty good.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 And so this is, um, when somebody passes over to the other side, there's

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.120
 still kind of learning how to communicate.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.800
 Um, imagine you had to tell somebody about yourself by giving them symbols,

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.680
 right?

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:20.840
 Like a bird or a train or like, I got images of like plaid, like a red plaid,

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.640
 um, trains and cars.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.680
 And so this is where you're going to have to tell me if I'm off or if I'm,

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.880
 well, if, if you're doing a cold reading, you're doing a really good job.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:38.520
 So my grandpa, uh, after he died and we, you know, went through all of his

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.280
 things, one of the things that I took was a plaid jacket.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:50.440
 And he was a politician who spent his entire life, uh, focused on public

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.000
 transit.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.440
 And in particular, he really loved trains.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.800
 That's so great.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.720
 So he's there.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.120
 And so he's doing a pretty good job of presenting himself, um, so that you

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.280
 would recognize him.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.760
 Um,

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:11.720
 he feels like he would be able to navigate a situation well, but you'd

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.080
 never be able to really know what he's feeling.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:21.960
 He was, you know, kind of a cold guy in a way.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:28.120
 He definitely had a hard time talking about his emotions, except for anger and

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:28.640
 resentment.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.480
 Yeah.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.840
 There's, there's, he's still discovering and working through emotions.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:38.680
 When, um, I, I typically would be able to pick up on the feeling of what it is.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.280
 Like they're wanting to share this feeling.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.800
 And it feels like he has these things that are stacked and he's still working

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.640
 through and sorting through how to feel them and then present those emotions.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.160
 It feels like he's working through things.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:57.200
 And that it's hard for him to look back on his life and see the damage.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.360
 Yeah.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:05.560
 I mean, that, that does resonate, you know, he, uh, he and I hadn't spoken in years

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.600
 and years before he died.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.920
 Um, he had kind of a falling out with my mother that he was just a person who would

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:17.200
 get really angry and feel aggrieved and then he couldn't let go of a grudge and

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.360
 didn't know how to move on.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.280
 Um, and you know, we had this fight with my mom and stop talking to her.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.040
 So I kind of stopped talking to him.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:29.680
 And there were a lot of people in his life like that.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.240
 Um, he doesn't have any graduates that he's holding on to.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:42.400
 He sees now. So your mom, you, and it feels like there's other people.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:49.840
 He did have other, you know, graduates like that, like he and his sister, like

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.240
 just hated each other.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.920
 I think it was more on his side.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:57.040
 Um, but yeah, that was a big source of strife in the family.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.240
 He, um, I, so I don't feel grudges anymore.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.760
 Like he does not feel like he has, right?

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.400
 Is it does feel like there's guilt.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.160
 And this is the part where we remember that you can work things out here or you

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.400
 can work things out on the other side and he's working things out on the other

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.640
 side. And he's kind of in that place where he's like, Oh, shit balls.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.440
 I did a lot.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:25.400
 You know, in the years, you know, after he and my mother had this falling out,

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.360
 like I really.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.560
 Resented the problems that he was causing.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.160
 Um, and.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.800
 You know, even right after his death, I was, you know, I learned more about how he

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:47.200
 lived his life and his relationship with my mother and her siblings and a.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:57.560
 Uh, I was pretty angry, but I thought and, you know, talk to people.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.840
 About his, you know, personal struggles and his mental health and.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.400
 It shifted more towards.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.000
 Kind of, I guess, pity and understanding.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.480
 Um, and he can hear you and he knows what's going on, even though you can't,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.360
 you are not, you know, tuning into him.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.480
 Yeah, I don't, uh, I don't think he had a lot of.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:32.280
 Joy in his life, there was certainly some, uh, but I guess if he's, you know,

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.240
 kicking around somewhere, I hope he figures it out.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.160
 Yeah.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.960
 Like he takes full responsibility for everything.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.080
 Hmm.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.400
 Just going to go ahead and sever that tie right now with him.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.240
 Okay.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.080
 Wow.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.440
 I mean, that was the first time that I've ever talked to a dead guy.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:54.960
 Yeah.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.600
 How, uh, so how do you guys feel about that?

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.560
 I mean, uh, like, I don't know.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:10.000
 Obviously we'll never know whether Ashley is actually tapped into, you know,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.200
 what she says that she is, but whether or not that was, you know, real,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.880
 whatever that means, like that was a really intense experience.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.480
 Like I kind of teared up a couple of the times.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.800
 And it's interesting, like just thinking about what that can do for you.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.920
 Like I don't think I would have been able to engage with, you know, these

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.520
 thoughts and like, you know, emotions I've been having about my grandfather,

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.440
 like, because how else are you going to do it?

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:37.840
 Right?

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.960
 Like it almost doesn't matter whether it's.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.480
 Whether it was a real thing from an emotional perspective because it felt real.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:46.800
 Yeah.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.200
 It sounds like it's a real for you.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:48.720
 Yeah.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.960
 Joe.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.840
 Well, she also plaids her mother's father.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.160
 Yeah, it's fucking strange.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:55.960
 Yeah.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.440
 Yeah.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.880
 I mean, that's how, you know, I, I like Ashley.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.320
 I trust her.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.680
 I don't think she was doing cold reading, but that is how cold readings work, right?

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:08.400
 I mean, I was going to go further and be like the probability that she got

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:15.000
 that it's your mother's father, plaid t-shirts and trains out of the

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.760
 entire English language.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.600
 Like what is the probability of that?

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.520
 That's got to be like astronomically low, right?

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.320
 Yeah.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.760
 I mean, I'm sure if we talk to someone who debunk psychics, right,

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.880
 there's these people that that's like their whole job, presumably,

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:35.280
 they could pick apart all the reasons why it's not amazing that she was able to,

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.320
 you know, guess or whatever it is, all these details about my relationship with

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.240
 my grandpa and the fact that I wanted to talk to him and like what, you know,

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:50.080
 color the jacket that he gave me was, but it, it really did help me lock in that.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.840
 She was saying all these things that were bizarrely coincidental.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.800
 Yeah.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.320
 And I will say that like even that thing that we were all doing when she was doing

00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.560
 that, what are the odds of this?

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.680
 How did she do this?

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.920
 I think that's what we need to try to quiet.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.680
 Right.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.200
 As we go through this process, right?

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:11.240
 Like you like allow yourself to be amazed by that because that's how you will

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.280
 experience greater meaning from what follows, right?

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.960
 Evan, how did, how did you feel about all that?

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.400
 How did you feel about your reading?

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.120
 Yeah.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.880
 Like I thought some of it was on and some of it was slightly off, you know?

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:28.080
 It's so funny to me because like I could hear you.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.360
 Not getting much out of it.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.800
 And, or this is my interpretation.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.920
 I could, I felt like I could hear you not getting much out of it at the same

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:44.440
 time as I was feeling and hearing so much meaning and acuity in what she was

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.600
 saying for your life in particular.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:46.800
 Yeah.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.160
 I mean, it sounded like the kinds of things that I would tell you.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.040
 So, yeah, I guess the reason why I, you know, maybe I, what came across is like

00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.320
 me not really connecting with what she was saying is like, if I were to ask you

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.760
 guys that same question about like, you know, when will I be ready to like find

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.520
 another partner?

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.720
 Yeah, you might give me the exact same advice.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.680
 And like it's true.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.160
 But again, it's not like what is the difference when that information comes

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.600
 from one of my close friends, like one of you guys, or whether it comes from a

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.920
 median/psychic.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.000
 Well, I guess for me, what separates it is the fact that Ashley gave you the

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.680
 same advice that I would give you feels like magic.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.360
 Right.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.360
 Like how did she know to give you the same advice that I would give you as

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.760
 someone who's been your friend for years now and whether or not that's meaningful

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.000
 to you is a really personal thing.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.160
 And I don't think that she did that again.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.040
 But like we prompted her with these questions, right?

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.000
 So she's, she knew that I would just recently gotten into a, that I'm dealing

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.840
 with a breakup because we told her that she knows that I'm looking for a new job

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.680
 because I told her that.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.720
 And so it's, you know, it's not that much of a stretch really at all for somebody

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.000
 to be like, yeah, like you probably are feeling a little shut down.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.480
 You're feeling a little hurt right now.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.360
 You know, the next person is going to come when like you're opening up back,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.920
 you're opening back up a little bit more.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.720
 You're ready to accept love, et cetera, et cetera.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.160
 Like that just to me is like a logical next step, but maybe you're right.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:08.600
 Like I don't know.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.920
 Maybe I, maybe it is something more anomalistic that this person who's a

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.440
 complete stranger gave me this similar advice.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:21.240
 So I guess my question then is for you, was the Ashley experience a failed

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.640
 experiment or did it work for you?

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.200
 Sure.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:25.320
 Yeah.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.680
 She said some interesting things, but like very easily this could be, you know,

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.600
 this other thing.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.680
 It doesn't mean that I believe it is her just doing like a cold reading.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.360
 It just means like, yeah, it's possible, right?

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.800
 But it also what goes along with that is, is, is, yeah, me just not being so

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.360
 like easily impressed with people.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:47.120
 So what's interesting to me, Evan, I saw your defenses up at that time.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.400
 And I feel like that's being validated now.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:56.240
 And what I would like you to ask yourself is, is this resistance?

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:02.120
 This skepticism that you can't let it like go of preventing you from seeing

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.800
 the meaning in your reading that I saw in your reading.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.440
 It's not that I'm skeptic in my mind or I'm defensive.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.800
 It's just that like, I don't know.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:18.680
 And it's rational thinking in, in my mind that it's rational thinking to me to just

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.680
 be like, Oh yeah, there are other ways that this information could be coming up.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.280
 But it doesn't mean that's what it is.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.720
 It just means that it's possible.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.000
 Joey, what did you think about your reading?

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.920
 I really like this idea that I'm going to this place to blossom.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.320
 It'll be hard at first, but then it'll be beautiful and I'll come away with

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.480
 some like really meaningful new relationships and leave.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.720
 I like, I like all of those basic features.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.200
 I like you leaving the Bay Area too.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:50.920
 Yeah.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.440
 I just feel like home for Joey.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:52.720
 Yeah.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.720
 I don't think it's a natural fit, but it's also kind of what I need.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.920
 And like, I don't know.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.320
 Yeah.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:05.840
 So it sounds like long story short, you might recommend psychics to people.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.600
 And I think after the experience that I had, I kind of agree.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:15.640
 But it's, I mean, I can get on board with that, but I think it's important to like

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:21.080
 explain our perspective in using psychics.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:27.320
 The reason I loved Ashley and this day or this record is that

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.240
 everything that happened fits perfectly.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:38.320
 Like in the world where everything that happened was meaningful and specific to

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.360
 us and real and deep and prophetic.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:48.120
 And in the reality where like everything is statistical and cold reading and we were

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.080
 mirror just, she's just mirroring our energy and all that, right?

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.360
 Like everything we're going to encounter, it's not going to fall cleanly in one

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.720
 or the other and it will be up to us to choose the one, you know?

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.160
 Like her brother, right?

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.040
 Like she had this experience of seeing her brother and interacting with him.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.360
 And like there is no, did that happen or didn't that happen?

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:09.960
 It happened.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.920
 She had that experience.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.040
 She described it to us.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:12.600
 You know what I mean?

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.520
 The only thing you can ask is if she'd lying or not.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.320
 And I think we all believe that the answer is definitely not.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.080
 She is not a lie.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.560
 Certainly didn't feel to me like she was being dishonest at any point.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:20.880
 Yes.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.000
 So beyond that, like there is no reality or not that it is real.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.240
 Like that experience happened.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.800
 So where do we go from here?

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.600
 I guess I got to unblock my shockers, right?

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.900
 Yeah, I think so.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.000
 - I think that's next.
