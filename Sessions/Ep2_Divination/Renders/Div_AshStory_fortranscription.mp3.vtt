WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Ashley, how are you?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 I'm good.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Try not to be nervous.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 I'm also nervous.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 We're all feeling a little bit nervous.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Yeah.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 So first off, like, I don't have a clarity of what it is that you do.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Like, is there, you can explain it to us?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.800
 Well, the simple way is I do psychic medium readings where I tune in to your energy and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.200
 try to get that snapshot of your future.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.240
 And then I can connect with people on the other side if that's what people want.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.640
 Wait, so like, have you always done this or do you have a job job that you go to every

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.480
 day, like a nine to five?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.280
 So my day job is I investigate scams and financial exploitation for a living.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.080
 So, you know, that's very, uh, follow the evidence and the proof and look at everything

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.560
 logically and it's very, very different in process.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.680
 And the truth is you are and you're, you're a detective in both lives.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 You're just looking at this.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 Yeah.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.400
 It's just working different sides of my brain and different sides of my soul.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.480
 I don't know.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.640
 Um, so it's, it's very different.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.000
 Uh, I don't tell people because it's so taboo.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.200
 It's just taboo.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.880
 Um, and the fact that a lot of times mediums will get or psychomediums will be labeled

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 as a scam.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.240
 And so it's like, well, I don't want, you know, the people that I work with to.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 Yes.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.400
 You know, get the impression that I'm scamming people, but I don't, I don't charge.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.680
 I don't do a lot of other things that regular, um, full time mediums do.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.080
 So I, I feel like I dodged the bullet there.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.640
 Um, what, how do you feel your life is enriched now with respect to those periods when you

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.120
 were closed off from it?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.480
 Like what, what have you, what have you gained by opening yourself to it?

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.480
 Yeah.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.320
 Like a whole different life altering perspective that helps calm my fear of death that helps

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.880
 calm my fear of my loved ones dying.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.480
 And when you tap into that need that that other person has and connect to that and help

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.320
 them with that need, I, I don't know how to describe that.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.000
 It's saying that it's profound for both, for both of us.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.240
 And so it's like, I get to experience how, how loved someone else is.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.240
 Yeah.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.240
 So I think we should get into that.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.800
 Why don't you talk about like, like, what, what you told me, like, like your beginnings

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.560
 and why this is a natural step for you.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.960
 And then also how your relationship with your abilities have like evolved over time.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.480
 Um, I probably had my first experience when I was, there's probably five.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.840
 Um, I was in my backyard.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.240
 And for this brief second, I just saw this, um, image of a person.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.360
 Uh, like when I see a spirit, it's like an outline of a person, but in static.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.360
 And I knew it was my grandpa.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.920
 Did you know what was going on?

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.360
 Like, did you, like, were you able to sort of, like, where, where were you mentally, emotionally,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.040
 uh, during these sort of first occurrences?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.000
 So it still didn't occur to me that not everybody saw this stuff.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.600
 Because I grew up in the community and the culture and the religion that there are angels

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.680
 and there are demons and there are, um, entities of light and good and everybody has a spirit

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.160
 and sometimes you see them and there's this, all of these stories throughout our church

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.760
 history of people seeing things.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.320
 So it's like, this is just, everybody sees things.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320
 Uh, yeah.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.320
 I guess I, yeah.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.920
 So how do you refer to this, this kind of empathy that you do?

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.920
 Like, is it mediumship?

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.520
 Uh, like what, what do you call it?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.040
 Uh, it's like an extreme ability to empathize whether people want me to or not.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.720
 There's permission involved.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.720
 Hmm.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.000
 Um, Joey mentioned something about your family and we were wondering if you would be comfortable

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.440
 talking about that and sort of what you learned from that experience and, and, and I guess

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.440
 what happened.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.920
 Sure.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.160
 My brother and I'm very close.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.000
 He committed suicide five years ago.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.720
 Um, so anyway, my, my brother, uh, appeared as this mass in my bedroom, like in back to

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.360
 the, the static, the, just like the static outline of a person and the energy that I

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.640
 was feeling from him was so intense, like guilt.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.360
 And I, it was like I knew that death didn't bring him what he thought it would.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.520
 Um, feeling and knowing that death didn't accomplish what he thought he would.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.880
 And he was like just rocked with regret.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.120
 And so the only thing I knew to do was say like, we're going to be okay.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.680
 Let you can move forward.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.320
 Did you feel, I mean, like that, that's such an awful, like it's like,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.680
 the worst feeling you could have after losing a loved one to also have this feeling that

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.720
 like they're not even that piece.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.680
 I mean, so I'm wondering like when you, when you said what you said to him, did you feel

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.520
 like there was some connection there?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.720
 Like it made contact.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.840
 Well, that one thing taught me one thing that you are the same here as you are on the

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.000
 other side.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.440
 You don't magically change.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.440
 You are the same.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.600
 So it's not going to accomplish what you think it will.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.300
 Um, you're either going to have to fix it now with your body or you're going to have to

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.620
 fix it on the other side.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.640
 You can pick which one, but it's probably easier here than to fix it on the other side.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.680
 So I'm still going to need therapy after I die.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680
 Yeah.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.680
 Exactly.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.680
 Exactly.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.320
 So you can get therapy now or you can get therapy there.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.520
 Um, also what's a copay look like on the show?

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.720
 I might have better insurance.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.720
 So you see your brother.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.260
 So I see my brother and that was very sad.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.100
 Um, and anyway, then like, oh, there was two weeks between when he died and when we had

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.900
 the funeral for him.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.900
 And a few days before the funeral, I have this very intense and real dream where he

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.700
 comes to me and like I'm sitting with my husband in a restaurant who walks in and he's like,

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.740
 okay, at that point.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.740
 I'm so sorry.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.900
 God damn.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:28.680
 I mean, I'm glad that he's okay, but like fuck, you know, um, one last thing before we start.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.360
 Can you tell us like what you're going to do, like physically or mentally?

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.760
 Like what do you do to prepare or like maintain this like state of openness?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:47.740
 I usually will do some stretches and, um, shocker work and ask that, um, that I may be

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:56.860
 able to know, think channel, uh, to the best of my ability to help you the most.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.860
 Huh.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.860
 So how do we start?
